<p>There is no problem with your code as far as I see, but the problem is you do all the stuff inside <code>onCreate</code>.</p>

<p><code>onCreate</code> method is only called on the creation of the activity, as the name suggests. Since there is no input at the create time, your <code>contentTitle</code> and <code>contentText</code> will be empty strings and notification will not appear as desired.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, you need to get the text from your edittext widgets and create the notification inside <code>onClick</code> method of the button you placed. In other words, you need to carry all these stuff you created</p>

<pre><code>int icon = R.drawable.ic_launcher;
CharSequence tickerText = "Reminder Created";
long when = System.currentTimeMillis();
Context context = getApplicationContext();
CharSequence contentTitle = mTitle.getText().toString();
CharSequence contentText = mContent.getText().toString();
Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
PendingIntent contentIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, notificationIntent, 0);


final Notification notification = new Notification(icon, tickerText, when);
notification.setLatestEventInfo(context, contentTitle, contentText, contentIntent);


String ns = Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
final NotificationManager mNotificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(ns);
</code></pre>

<p>inside <code>onClick</code> method you override before you notify the notification manager. </p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
