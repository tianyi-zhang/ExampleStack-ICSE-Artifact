<p>I'm pretty sure you can't "make the ImageView round," since all Views are actually rectangular, so what you're going to have to do is fake it.</p>

<p>Use a method like this to cut a circle from the image:</p>

<pre><code>public Bitmap getRoundedBitmap(Bitmap scaleBitmapImage) {
    int targetRadius = scaleBitmapImage.getWidth();
    if(targetRadius &gt; scaleBitmapImage.getHeight()) targetRadius = scaleBitmapImage.getHeight();

    Bitmap targetBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(targetRadius, targetRadius, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);

    Canvas canvas = new Canvas(targetBitmap);
    Path path = new Path();
    path.addCircle(((float) scaleBitmapImage.getWidth() - 1) / 2, ((float) scaleBitmapImage.getHeight() - 1) / 2, (Math.min(((float) scaleBitmapImage.getWidth()), ((float) scaleBitmapImage.getHeight())) / 2), Path.Direction.CCW);

    canvas.clipPath(path);
    Bitmap sourceBitmap = scaleBitmapImage;
    canvas.drawBitmap(sourceBitmap, new Rect(0, 0, sourceBitmap.getWidth(), sourceBitmap.getHeight()), new Rect(0, 0, scaleBitmapImage.getWidth(), scaleBitmapImage.getHeight()), null);

    return targetBitmap;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the clipped part is transparent, it will appear as if the actual View is a circle. Also make sure that the bounds of the View are squared (or that adjustViewBounds="true") else you may get visual distortions in terms of width or height.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that's as close to a "rounded View" as you can actually get.</p>
