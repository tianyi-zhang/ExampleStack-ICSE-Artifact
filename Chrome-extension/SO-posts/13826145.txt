<p>It appears that as of Java 7, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/435579/298389">David Santamaria's answer</a> doesn't work reliably any more. It looks like you can still reliably use a Socket to test the connection, however.</p>

<pre><code>private static boolean available(int port) {
    System.out.println("--------------Testing port " + port);
    Socket s = null;
    try {
        s = new Socket("localhost", port);

        // If the code makes it this far without an exception it means
        // something is using the port and has responded.
        System.out.println("--------------Port " + port + " is not available");
        return false;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("--------------Port " + port + " is available");
        return true;
    } finally {
        if( s != null){
            try {
                s.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException("You should handle this error." , e);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
