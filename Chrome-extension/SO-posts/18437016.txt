<p>It is possible to disable the key size restrictions simply by using a few lines of reflection. We use this method in our program which needs access to 256-bit cryptography for interoperability purposes.</p>

<pre><code>private static void removeCryptographyRestrictions() {
    if (!isRestrictedCryptography()) {
        return;
    }
    try {
        java.lang.reflect.Field isRestricted;
        try {
            final Class&lt;?&gt; c = Class.forName("javax.crypto.JceSecurity");
            isRestricted = c.getDeclaredField("isRestricted");
        } catch (final ClassNotFoundException e) {
            try {
                // Java 6 has obfuscated JCE classes
                final Class&lt;?&gt; c = Class.forName("javax.crypto.SunJCE_b");
                isRestricted = c.getDeclaredField("g");
            } catch (final ClassNotFoundException e2) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
        isRestricted.setAccessible(true);
        isRestricted.set(null, false);
    } catch (final Throwable e) {
        logger.log(Level.WARNING,
                "Failed to remove cryptography restrictions", e);
    }
}

private static boolean isRestrictedCryptography() {
    return "Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment"
            .equals(System.getProperty("java.runtime.name"));
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, our program is not an applet, and I am not sure whether applets have access to the reflection API.</p>

<p>The question about legality also remains. There is a reason for that limit. Consult a lawyer if you are concerned.</p>

<p>If possible, try to keep it to 128-bit keys. Even when taking Moore's law into consideration, breaking 128-bit AES would take billions upon billions of years. Longer keys offer no benefit in the real world â€“ particularly when the keys are derived from passwords, which don't have anywhere near 256 bits of entropy anyway.</p>
