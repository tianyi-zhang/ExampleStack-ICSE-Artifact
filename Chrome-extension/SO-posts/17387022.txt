<p>I am not sure if you are missing some code or what, but the addListenerOnButton() method is never called anywhere. I am going to assume that you were probably calling this inside of your activity's onCreate(). You probably also noticed that you cannot use getView() inside of a fragment's oncCreate() because the root view is not accessible until the inflate is called inside of onCreateView().</p>

<p>I recommend doing the following to fix your issue.</p>

<p>First remove the onClick line from your xml as you won't be needing that anymore since we will be registering the button programmatically.</p>

<p>You can also move all of the work you are doing inside of addListernOnButton() into onCreateView().</p>

<pre><code>View rootView;
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.activity_main, container, false);
    spinner1 = (Spinner) rootView.findViewById(R.id.spinner1);
    spinner2 = (Spinner) rootView.findViewById(R.id.spinner2);
    calculate = (Button) rootView.findViewById(R.id.calculate);
    calculate.setOnClickListener(this);
    edittextdollars = (EditText) rootView.findViewById(R.id.edittextdollars);
    edittexteuros = (EditText) rootView.findViewById(R.id.edittexteuros);
    return rootView;
}
</code></pre>
