<p>I solved the problem. In the end it was much easier to solve than expected.</p>

<p>The main problem was not the permission issue but the <code>FileNotFoundException</code>. The file that is assigned to the <code>OutputStream</code> is not really a file, but just a directory so that the Stream can't find it. You have to create the file before initializing the <code>OutputStream</code> and after that you copy your source file into the newly created file. The code:</p>

<pre><code>private void copyJar(File source, File dest) throws IOException {

        InputStream is = null;
        File dest2 = new File(dest+"/TheJar.jar");
        dest2.createNewFile();
        OutputStream os = null;
        try {
            is = new FileInputStream(source);
            os = new FileOutputStream(dest2);
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
            int length;
            while ((length = is.read(buffer))&gt;0) {
                os.write(buffer, 0, length);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } 
        is.close();
        os.close();

    }
</code></pre>
