<p>I think the code is working, except maybe that you don't see the output because it's swamped by all the <code>null</code>s you print. You should stop the while after the first <code>null</code>.
 More generally, <code>DataInputStream</code> and <code>DataOutputStream</code> are not the right classes for this job. Try this code.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Socket s = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 80);
    BufferedReader dIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(s.getInputStream()));
    PrintStream dOut = new PrintStream(s.getOutputStream());
    dOut.println("GET /index.php HTTP/1.0");
    dOut.println();
    String str = null;
    do {
        str = dIn.readLine();
        System.out.println(str);
    } while (str != null);
}
</code></pre>
