<p>The answer is I didn't have proper permission. I changed some classes and erased the app data so I lost the permission and I didn't have any measures for restoring them.</p>

<p>So, what's needed:</p>

<p>Check if the api-client gets connected (using <code>addOnConnectionFailedListener</code>) and if the connection fails run code similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>    //ConnectionResult result = intent.getExtras().getParcelable(OrderKeys.FITNESS_CONNECTION_FAILED_RESULT);
// This is my solution for service-activty communication, this is run in activty

            Log.i(TAG, "Connection failed. Cause: " + result.toString());
            if (!result.hasResolution()) {
                // Show the localized error dialog
                GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog(result.getErrorCode(),
                        LifeAidActivity.this, 0).show();
                return;
            }
            // The failure has a resolution. Resolve it.
            // Called typically when the app is not yet authorized, and an
            // authorization dialog is displayed to the user.
            if (!authInProgress) {
                try {
                    Log.i(TAG, "Attempting to resolve failed connection");
                    authInProgress = true;
                    result.startResolutionForResult(LifeAidActivity.this,
                            REQUEST_OAUTH);
                } catch (IntentSender.SendIntentException e) {
                    Log.e(TAG,
                            "Exception while starting resolution activity", e);
                }
            }
</code></pre>
