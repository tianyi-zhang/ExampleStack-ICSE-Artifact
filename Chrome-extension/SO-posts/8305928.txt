<p>I have similar problems in my application. The app is a widget that give possibility to use favorites contacts in fast way. User creates new widget and assigns contact to it. When he clicks on widget he is able to make common contact actions - call, sms, edit, etc.</p>

<p>Some users send report like this one: 
"I select about 4 contacts and the app shows 4 but only one of them right 3 others is same contact which I didnt even picked".
"Why does the wrong contact show when picked? On my droid incredible"</p>

<p>I can't reproduce the problem on my side. I have tried several different devices, tried to make import/export contacts - no results.</p>

<p>Anyway, i have some ideas about source of the problem. </p>

<p>My application uses lookup keys to store contacts, <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/contacts.html" rel="nofollow">according to sdk</a>. So, when user picks up a contact, application stores contact lookup key. Then it uses this lookup key to get Contact ID for this contact. After that, it uses ONLY received Contact ID in all other functions. So does your function - it uses only Contact ID in sub-query.</p>

<p>The question is: is it possible that different contacts (with different lookup keys) have same Contact ID?  It looks like it's possible on some devices in rare cases... <strike>If so, we need to use Contact ID + lookup key always together to identify contact.</strike> (<b>update: the suggestion was incorrect. Lookup key can be changed after contact info modification, you won't find contact</b>).</p>

<p>As I understand, you are able to reproduce the problem on your side. I would suggest to change your code in such way:</p>

<pre><code>     infobtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() 
     {
        public void onClick(View v) 
        { 
            ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
            Cursor cur = cr.query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);

            if (cur.getCount() &gt; 0) 
            {

                while (cur.moveToNext()) {
                id_contact = cur.getString(cur.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.Contacts._ID));
                name_contact = cur.getString(cur.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME));
                String lookup_key = cur.getString(cur.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.Contacts.LOOKUP_KEY));
                    if (name_contact.equals(name1))
                    {
                    Cursor pCur = cr.query(
                    ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI, null, 
                    ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTACT_ID +" = ? AND " + ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.LOOKUP_KEY + " = ?", new String[]{id_contact, lookup_key}, null);
                       id_contact2 = id_contact;

                        while (pCur.moveToNext()){
                        } 
                    pCur.close();
                    }
                }
                Intent intent_contacts = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("content://contacts/people/" + id_contact2));
                startActivity(intent_contacts);
            }

        }
     });
</code></pre>

<p>and try to reproduce the problem again. </p>
