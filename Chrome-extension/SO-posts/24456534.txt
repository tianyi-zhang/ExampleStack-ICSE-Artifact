<p>Yes, it is possible - checkout SequenceFileWriter. See the following code example, which writes clustered data points to a file. Here is a <a href="http://skife.org/mahout/2013/02/14/first_steps_with_mahout.html" rel="nofollow">blog</a> post that describes this in great detail: </p>

<pre><code>public static void writePointsToFile(List&lt;Vector&gt; points,
                                     String fileName,
                                     FileSystem fs,
                                     Configuration conf) throws IOException {
    Path path = new Path(fileName);
    SequenceFile.Writer writer = new SequenceFile.Writer(fs, conf,
            path, LongWritable.class, VectorWritable.class);
    long recNum = 0;
    VectorWritable vec = new VectorWritable();
    for (Vector point : points) {
        vec.set(point);
        writer.append(new LongWritable(recNum++), vec);
    }
    writer.close();
}
</code></pre>
