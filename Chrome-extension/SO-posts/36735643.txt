<p>I dont know why I am unable to get the file through Unity Engine, I had to write custom plugin is Java and use that in Unity Project and that some how has worked.</p>

<p>Following is the code which return string after reading the file on both rooted and non rooted devices</p>

<pre><code>    public static String getCocos2DPrefsFile(String mPackageName)
{
    //Get the text file
            File file = new File("/data/data/"+mPackageName+"/shared_prefs/","Cocos2dxPrefsFile.xml");

            //Read text from file
            StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

            try {
                BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
                String line;

                while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                    text.append(line);
                    text.append('\n');
                }
                br.close();
            }
            catch (IOException e) {
                //You'll need to add proper error handling here
                Log.d("Error", e.toString());
            }
            return text.toString();
}
</code></pre>
