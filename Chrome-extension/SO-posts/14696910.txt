<p>First make sure that your application has the appropriate permissions including <code>android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code></p>

<p>Then you can copy the file from your resources to the android device. Here is an example code for <strong>illustration purpose only</strong>, change it as needed:</p>

<pre><code>private void copyMp3() throws IOException{

// Open your mp3 file as the input stream
InputStream myInput = getAssets().open("your_file.mp3");

// Path to the output file on the device
String outFileName = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(
        Environment.DIRECTORY_MUSIC),"your_file.mp3");

OutputStream myOutput = new FileOutputStream(outFileName);

//transfer bytes from the inputfile to the outputfile
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
int length;
while ((length = myInput.read(buffer))&gt;0 ){
   myOutput.write(buffer, 0, length);
}

//Close the streams =&gt; Better to have it in *final* block
myOutput.flush();
myOutput.close();
myInput.close();

}
</code></pre>

<p>The media scanner should pick the file by itself (unless there is .nomedia file in that folder), but if you want to speed the process you can use the link you have referred to in your question.</p>
