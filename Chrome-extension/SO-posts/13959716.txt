<p>Sometimes, you know there will always be a limited number of items, maybe 5, maybe 40. In those times you still want to use a ListView and you still want to wrap content.</p>

<p>For those times there is this method:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Computes the widest view in an adapter, best used when you need to wrap_content on a ListView, please be careful
 * and don't use it on an adapter that is extremely numerous in items or it will take a long time.
 *
 * @param context Some context
 * @param adapter The adapter to process
 * @return The pixel width of the widest View
 */
public static int getWidestView(Context context, Adapter adapter) {
    int maxWidth = 0;
    View view = null;
    FrameLayout fakeParent = new FrameLayout(context);
    for (int i=0, count=adapter.getCount(); i&lt;count; i++) {
        view = adapter.getView(i, view, fakeParent);
        view.measure(View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED, View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED);
        int width = view.getMeasuredWidth();
        if (width &gt; maxWidth) {
            maxWidth = width;
        }
    }
    return maxWidth;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Use it like so (notice I added some extra space to the width just in case):</p>

<pre><code>listView.getLayoutParams().width = getWidestView(mContext, adapter)*1.05;
</code></pre>
