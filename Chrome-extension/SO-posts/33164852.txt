<p>I faced the same problem. There are two types of permissions in Android:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dangerous (access to contacts, write to external storage...)</li>
<li>Normal</li>
</ul>

<p>Normal permissions are automatically approved by Android while dangerous permissions need to be approved by Android users.</p>

<p>Here is the strategy to get dangerous permissions in Android 6.0</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if you have the permission granted</li>
<li>If your app is already granted the permission, go ahead and perform normally.</li>
<li>If your app doesn't have the permission yet, ask for user to approve</li>
<li>Listen to user approval in onRequestPermissionsResult</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is my case: I need to write to external storage.</p>

<p>First, I check if I have the permission:</p>

<pre><code>...
private static final int REQUEST_WRITE_STORAGE = 112;
...
boolean hasPermission = (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(activity,
            Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED);
if (!hasPermission) {
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(parentActivity,
                new String[]{Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},
                REQUEST_WRITE_STORAGE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then check the user's approval:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
    super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    switch (requestCode)
    {
        case REQUEST_WRITE_STORAGE: {
            if (grantResults.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED)
            {
                //reload my activity with permission granted or use the features what required the permission
            } else
            {
                Toast.makeText(parentActivity, "The app was not allowed to write to your storage. Hence, it cannot function properly. Please consider granting it this permission", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>
