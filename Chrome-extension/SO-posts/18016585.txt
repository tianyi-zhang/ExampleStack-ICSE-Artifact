<p>Not quite sure about the <strong>spinner object</strong> question as it's been quite some time since I've used it, <strong>but as for writing to a file</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>public void writeToFile() {
        try {

            String content = "This is the content to write into file";

            File file = new File("filename.txt");

            // if file doesnt exists, then create it
            if (!file.exists()) {
                file.createNewFile();
            }

            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file.getAbsoluteFile());
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
            bw.write(content);
            bw.close();

            System.out.println("Done writing to file.");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Please reply if there are any problems.</p>
