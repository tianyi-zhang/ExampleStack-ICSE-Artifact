<p>Without any code, no one, except maybe Jon Skeet, can tell you where the problem is. But from looking at the logcat, you are trying to access an element of an <code>Array</code> that is more than what is in your <code>Array</code></p>

<p>This line here</p>

<pre><code> Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=3; index=3
</code></pre>

<p>gives the exception saying you are trying to access index 3 but the size of your array is 3 so the highest possible index is 2 since an <code>Array</code> has a base of 0.</p>

<p>This line here (the first line after the exception which references your project) says which line in which <code>Activity</code> and what method that line is in</p>

<pre><code>at com.example.wadi3mrad.MainActivity.addListenerOnButton(MainActivity.java:81)
</code></pre>

<p>Line 81 of <code>MainActivity</code> when adding a <code>listener</code> to a <code>Button</code>.</p>

<p>I realize this isn't an answer but you know what they say..."Teach a man to fish..."</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Let's see how this goes. Since all of these buttons pretty much do one thing, a much easier and cleaner way to do this would be to declare on <code>onClick</code> function for all of these buttons in your xml then you don't need all of the listeners and the button array.</p>

<p>In your xml, for each button, add something like this line</p>

<pre><code>android:onClick="someFunction"
</code></pre>

<p>then you just need one function in your Java and you don't need all of the other stuff. So your Java code would look like</p>

<pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, 
WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
}

public void someFunction(View v)
{
   Intent myIntent = new Intent();
     switch (v.getId()) // get id of Button clicked
     {
         case (R.id.music):
         myIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this,
                Albums.class);
        break;
         case (R.id.bio):
         myIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this,
                biog.class);
         break;
         case (R.id.face):
         myIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this,
                faceboom.class);
         break;
         case (R.id.info_but):
         myIntent = new Intent(MainActivity.this,
                info.class);
         break;
     }
   startActivity(myIntent);
}
</code></pre>
