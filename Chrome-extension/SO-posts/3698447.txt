<p>Just for curiousity: did you try to prefix your URL with "http://"?</p>

<p>I'm using the following helper to open my HTTP connection:</p>

<pre><code>private InputStream openHttpConnection() throws IOException {
    InputStream in = null;
    int response = -1;

    URL url = new URL("http://www.myserver.com/someurl");
    URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();

    if (!(conn instanceof HttpURLConnection))
       throw new IOException("Not an HTTP connection");

    try {
       HttpURLConnection httpConn = (HttpURLConnection) conn;
       httpConn.setAllowUserInteraction(false);
       httpConn.setInstanceFollowRedirects(true);
       httpConn.setRequestMethod("GET");
       httpConn.connect();

       response = httpConn.getResponseCode();
       if (response == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {
          in = httpConn.getInputStream();
       }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
       throw new IOException("Error connecting");
    }
    return in;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe that helps.</p>
