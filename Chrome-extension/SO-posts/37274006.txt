<p>You left out a lot of information and code, but I'll still try to answer your question, based on what I think your problem is:</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, your php file that serves as your GET request from the database works fine, but you aren't being able to call it on your Android.</p>

<p>I too had some problems with GET requests on Android when I first started, and all the classes I was supposed to use (those that were included on the tutorials), were deprecated.</p>

<p>I finally searched around enough and made something that worked, and saved a sample of what I did on my PasteBin. I'll share it with you how you're supposed to make a GET Request on Android, and all you have to do is apply it to your project.</p>

<pre><code> public class Main2Activity extends AppCompatActivity {

public static String URL;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main2);

    URL = "http://The-URL-To-Your-PHP-File";
    ConnectToDatabase connect = new ConnectToDatabase();
    Thread th = new Thread(connect);
    th.start();
}

  class ConnectToDatabase implements Runnable {

    public void run() {
        Log.d("link", URL);
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        try {
            URL url = new URL(URL);
            HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                result.append(line);
            }
            urlConnection.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        /*
            RESULT - DO WHATEVER WITH IT
        */
        Log.d("result", result.toString());


    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should work. If it doesn't, then, for the love of god, give us what the error message is.</p>
