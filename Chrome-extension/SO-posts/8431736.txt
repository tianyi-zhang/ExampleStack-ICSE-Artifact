<p>Your problem is probably from this line (or if it isn't yet it will be): <code>parameters.setPreviewSize(width, height);</code>  </p>

<p>Actual cameras can't support every preview size. You need to choose a preview size that is close to the size of your surface and supported by the camera hardware. Here's a sample method to do that:</p>

<pre><code>private  Camera.Size getBestPreviewSize(int width, int height,
                                          Camera.Parameters parameters) {
     Camera.Size result=null;

    for ( Camera.Size size : parameters.getSupportedPreviewSizes()) {
      if (size.width&lt;=width &amp;&amp; size.height&lt;=height) {
        if (result==null) {
          result=size;
        }
        else {
          int resultArea=result.width*result.height;
          int newArea=size.width*size.height;

          if (newArea&gt;resultArea) {
            result=size;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    return(result);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>You may also have a problem calling <code>Camera.open()</code> in <code>surfaceCreated</code> without checking whether or not the camera has already been opened. Try moving that call to your <code>onCreate</code> and <code>onResume</code> methods and adding a call to <code>Camera.release()</code> in your <code>onPause</code> method so that you don't attempt to open the camera more than once. </p>
