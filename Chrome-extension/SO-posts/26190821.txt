<blockquote>
  <p>Fragment #2 has a additional padding in the root layout</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it is not padding. Gap between blue and red line is called optical bounds (or optical insets).
<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.3.html#UI" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All layout elements also honor the optical bounds of their child views, adapting their own bounds based on the optical bounds of the views within them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And look at computeOpticalInsets() in ViewGroup</p>

<pre><code>Insets computeOpticalInsets() {
    if (isLayoutModeOptical()) {
        int left = 0;
        int top = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int bottom = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; mChildrenCount; i++) {
            View child = getChildAt(i);
            if (child.getVisibility() == VISIBLE) {
                Insets insets = child.getOpticalInsets();
                left =   Math.max(left,   insets.left);
                top =    Math.max(top,    insets.top);
                right =  Math.max(right,  insets.right);
                bottom = Math.max(bottom, insets.bottom);
            }
        }
        return Insets.of(left, top, right, bottom);
    } else {
        return Insets.NONE;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, optical bounds of parent are maximum of optical bounds of his children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My goal is to remove that padding, so that I can place &amp; layout the TextView entirely based on it's inner optical bounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can not place TextView entirely based on it's inner optical bounds, because its parent can has other children with optical bounds.
Why do you want to remove this gap? It is not visible to user</p>
