  <p><strong>Explaination why it gives null data :</strong></p>
  
  <p>Keep it mind that Google will store data from their side only when you
  are trying to purchase one time purchase product. But Whenever you
  purchased consumable item google play store will not be managed it's
  product purchased detail and other things in the Google play console.
  That's why we have to call consumeAsync() method. when we purchased
  item, Google play store keep record item has been purchased for the
  one time and allow you to purchased second time.</p>

<p>But, Here you are trying to purchase product as a single time purchase so you must not need to call consumeAsync() method in onIabPurchasedFinishListener.</p>

<p>Hope it will solve your problem.</p>
