<p>First make sure that the shell command that you need is actually available in Android. I've run into issues by assuming you can do things like redirect output with <strong>></strong>.</p>

<p>This method also works on non-rooted phones of I believe v2.2, but you should check the API reference to be sure.</p>

<pre><code>try {
        Process chmod = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/system/bin/chmod 777 " +fileName);

        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(nfiq.getInputStream()));
        int read;
        char[] buffer = new char[4096];
        StringBuffer output = new StringBuffer();
        while ((read = reader.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) {
            output.append(buffer, 0, read);
        }
        reader.close();
        chmod.waitFor();
        outputString =  output.toString();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>While it's probably not 100% necessary, it's a good idea to have the process wait for the exec to complete with process.waitFor() since you said that you care about the output. </p>
