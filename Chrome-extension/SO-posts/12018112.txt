<p>RGBA_8888 corresponds to 1 as can be seen in the annex below.</p>

<p>If you go to the code related to mPixelFormat you find the following.</p>

<pre><code>// Following fields are initialized from native code
private int mPixelFormat;
</code></pre>

<p>That means that for some reason your device is being treated as RGB_565 due to an OS decision more than hardware capabilities.
Actually, that makes me feel curious.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough descriptions of Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 don't feel to have too much in common. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus" rel="nofollow">GN</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7" rel="nofollow">N7</a></p>
