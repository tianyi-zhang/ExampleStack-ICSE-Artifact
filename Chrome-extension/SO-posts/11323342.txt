<p>Even I faced this issue. Now I have a xml file which is has application properties.This is packaged in the assets folder.Once packaged we cannot edit a file in assets folder.
Now on app load I just copy this file to path returned by </p>

<pre><code>context.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath();
</code></pre>

<p>And the application edit it from the same place. You can see if the file is modified in the <strong>FileExplorer</strong> panel of <strong>DDMS</strong> view. The file is stored in the folder named same as your application package name for eg: com.abhi.maps</p>

<p>Alternatively you can also copy it to SD card.However it is risky because, sd card may bot be available all the time.</p>

<p>You can use the following code to copy file from assets folder:</p>

<pre><code>    private static void copyFile(String filename, Context context) {
    AssetManager assetManager = context.getAssets();

    InputStream in = null;
    OutputStream out = null;
    try {
        in = assetManager.open(filename);
        String newFileName = context.getFilesDir() + "/" + filename;
        out = new FileOutputStream(newFileName);

        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int read;
        while ((read = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            out.write(buffer, 0, read);
        }
        in.close();
        in = null;
        out.flush();
        out.close();
        out = null;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("tag", e.getMessage());
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps! :)</p>
