<p>I just opened the terminal app on my phone which is running Android 4.0+ and ran your command "cat /proc/meminfo". I did not allow the app to have "su" or "root" permissions, running as a normal app. The command completed successfully.</p>

<p>So if I can run it via command line using an application running on the phone, I am sure I can do via ADB shell and most likely in Java.</p>

<p>I've used this code in my applications before:</p>

<pre><code>try 
    {
    Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/system/bin/cat /proc/meminfo");
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));
    int read;
    char[] buffer = new char[4096];
    StringBuffer output = new StringBuffer();
    while ((read = reader.read(buffer)) &gt; 0) 
    {
        output.append(buffer, 0, read);
    }
    reader.close();
    process.waitFor();

    // wrap this in a method and return the string
    return output.toString();
} catch (Exception e) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I have tried to run commands what I do not have the correct permissions to run, I have gotten that error "GC_CONCURRENT".</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
