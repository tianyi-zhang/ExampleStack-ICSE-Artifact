<p>I had a similar issue.</p>

<p>If you would like to enter "DONE" and "NEXT", use</p>

<pre><code>long eventTime = SystemClock.uptimeMillis();
KeyEvent eventDOWN  = new KeyEvent(eventTime, eventTime,
 KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN, KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ENTER, 0, 0,
 KeyCharacterMap.VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD, 0,
 KeyEvent.FLAG_SOFT_KEYBOARD | KeyEvent.FLAG_KEEP_TOUCH_MODE
 | KeyEvent.FLAG_EDITOR_ACTION);

KeyEvent eventUP = new KeyEvent(SystemClock.uptimeMillis(), eventTime,
 KeyEvent.ACTION_UP, KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ENTER, 0, 0,
 KeyCharacterMap.VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD, 0,
 KeyEvent.FLAG_SOFT_KEYBOARD | KeyEvent.FLAG_KEEP_TOUCH_MODE
 | KeyEvent.FLAG_EDITOR_ACTION);
</code></pre>
