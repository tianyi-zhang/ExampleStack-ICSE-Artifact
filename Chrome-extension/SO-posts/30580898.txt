<p>It's hard to tell without seeing your code if you are doing anything wrong, but I just got a simple example working and tested by using the code from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15900180/is-it-possible-to-get-a-notification-when-any-location-provider-is-enabled-disab">here</a> as a guide, and adapting it to have the BroadcastReceiver in a library.</p>

<p>One thing to note:  The app using the library will need to have the <code>receiver</code> in it's AndroidManifest.xml.
See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6858070/how-to-declare-an-intent-filter-for-a-receiver-class-which-is-present-in-an-exte">here</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/vHqQZav7m6Y">here</a>, both contain information from @CommonsWare.</p>

<p>Adding quote here just in case the link goes bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Is there any way for a library project to independently register for a
    receiver in it's own manifest file?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Not at the present time.</p>

<p>So, any app that uses your library will need to have the <code>receiver</code> added in the AndroidManifest.xml.</p>

<p>Note that this was tested on Android 4.4.4 on a Samsung S4.</p>

<p>I got this working using a BroadcastReceiver in a library project compiled to a <code>aar</code>.</p>

<p>Using a <code>receiver</code> element set up in the AndroidManifest.xml of the main app that links to the <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> in the library, I was able to receive the event when any change is made to the Location settings:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Location toggle on</li>
<li>Location toggle off</li>
<li>Change Location Mode to High Accuracy</li>
<li>Change Location Mode to Power Saving</li>
<li>Change Location Mode to GPS only</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time a change is made in the location settings, the BroadcastReceiver in the library is triggered, even if the app is not running.</p>

<p>I used a simple test where the BroadcastReceiver in the library shows a Toast message every time the location settings are changed.</p>

<p>Here is LocationProviderChangedReceiver.java in the library project:</p>

<pre><code>import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.location.LocationManager;
import android.util.Log;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class LocationProviderChangedReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    private final static String TAG = "LocationProviderChanged";

    boolean isGpsEnabled;
    boolean isNetworkEnabled;

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        if (intent.getAction().matches("android.location.PROVIDERS_CHANGED"))
        {
            Log.i(TAG, "Location Providers changed");

            LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
            isGpsEnabled = locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);
            isNetworkEnabled = locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER);

            Toast.makeText(context, "GPS Enabled: " + isGpsEnabled + " Network Location Enabled: " + isNetworkEnabled, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the main app, I put the compiled <code>myLibrary.aar</code> in the libs folder, and set up the build.gradle to compile the aar:</p>

<pre><code> repositories{
        flatDir{
            dirs 'libs'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.1.1"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.3.0"

    compile 'com.mylibrary.daniel:mylibrary:1.0@aar'

}
</code></pre>

<p>Set up the <code>receiver</code> in the AndroidManifest.xml of the main app:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;receiver
        android:name="com.mylibrary.daniel.mylibrary.LocationProviderChangedReceiver"
        android:exported="false" &gt;
        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
            &lt;action android:name="android.location.PROVIDERS_CHANGED" /&gt;
            &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/receiver&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, installed the app, and modified location settings in a few different ways.  The BroadcastReceiver in the library was triggered every time:</p>
