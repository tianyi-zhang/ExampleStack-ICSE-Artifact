<p>Your code in <code>render()</code> looks very strange.</p>

<p>The first of all separate calls of your own <code>game.batch</code> and stage methods.
Then your <code>render()</code> method should look so:</p>

<pre><code>public void render(float delta) {
    Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0,0,1.0f,1); // You should call this method only once outside of draw()
    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL10.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    camera.update();
    game.batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);
    game.batch.begin();
    game.batch.draw(splsh, 0, 0,800,500);
    /* 
     * Render here everything that uses your camera and batch,
     * and is not a part of your stage.
     */
    game.batch.end();

    // And here is stage acts...
    stage.act(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());
    stage.draw();
    Table.drawDebug(stage);

    if (Gdx.input.isTouched()) {
        game.setScreen(new GameScreen(game));
        dispose();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should see all of your stage actors.</p>

<p>By the way, by default stage manage it's own camera and batch, so you don't have to do such things.</p>

<p>Hope this will helpful, good luck.</p>
