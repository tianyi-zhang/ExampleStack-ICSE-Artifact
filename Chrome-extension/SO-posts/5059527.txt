<p>The source code for that particular exception appears to have been updated with a rather more helpful error message:</p>

<pre><code> protected void onRestoreInstanceState(Parcelable state) {
        mPrivateFlags |= SAVE_STATE_CALLED;
        if (state != BaseSavedState.EMPTY_STATE &amp;&amp; state != null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Wrong state class, expecting View State but "
                    + "received " + state.getClass().toString() + " instead. This usually happens "
                    + "when two views of different type have the same id in the same hierarchy. "
                    + "This view's id is " + ViewDebug.resolveId(mContext, getId()) + ". Make sure "
                    + "other views do not use the same id.");
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I can see that you are using ID 1009 twice in your code, which might have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Ideally you would be using XML for your layout. It'll make your life significantly easier.</p>
