<p>Perhaps you have an encoding error. The constructor you are using for an InputStreamReader uses the default character encoding; if your file contains UTF-8 text outside the ASCII range, you will get garbage. Also, you don't need a DataInputStream, since you aren't reading any data objects from the stream. Try this code:</p>

<pre><code>FileInputStream fstream = null;
try {
    fstream = new FileInputStream("c:\\hello.txt");
    // Decode data using UTF-8
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in, "UTF-8"));
    String strLine;
    // Read File Line By Line
    while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null) {
        // Print the content on the console
        System.out.println(strLine);
    }
} catch (Exception e) {// Catch exception if any
    System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    if (fstream != null) {
        try { fstream.close(); }
        catch (IOException e) {
            // log failure to close file
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
