<p>Note: After fixing issue about recompiling the code (which I has mentioned in my comment), here is the tip to help your code run faster.</p>

<p>To avoid calling the same method <code>LCA2</code> twice, you should rewrite your method as follow:</p>

<pre><code>private static int LCA2(Node root, Node n1, Node n2)
{
    if(root == null)
        return -1;

    if(root.id == n1.id || root.id == n2.id)
        return root.id;

    int left = LCA2(root.left, n1, n2);
    int right = LCA2(root.right, n1, n2);

    if(left != -1 &amp;&amp; right != -1)
        return root.id;

    if(left != -1)
        return left; // you don't need to call the same routine again here, which will cost you some time.

    return right; //Similar reason

}
</code></pre>
