<p>I had the same problem and noticed that my overriden onMeasure() method wasn't called after the invalidate. So I created my own subroutine in the LinearLayout and called it before the invalidate() method.</p>

<p>Here is the code for an vertical LinearLayout:</p>

<pre><code>private void measure() {
    if (this.getOrientation() == LinearLayout.VERTICAL) {
        int h = 0;
        int w = 0;
        this.measureChildren(0, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.getChildCount(); i++) {
            View v = this.getChildAt(i);
            h += v.getMeasuredHeight();
            w = (w &lt; v.getMeasuredWidth()) ? v.getMeasuredWidth() : w;
        }
        height = (h &lt; height) ? height : h;
        width = (w &lt; width) ? width : w;
    }
    this.setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
}
</code></pre>
