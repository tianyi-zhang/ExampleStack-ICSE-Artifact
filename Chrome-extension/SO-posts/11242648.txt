<p>I got the solution working:</p>

<pre><code>private boolean isCompletelyWritten(File file) {
    RandomAccessFile stream = null;
    try {
        stream = new RandomAccessFile(file, "rw");
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.info("Skipping file " + file.getName() + " for this iteration due it's not completely written");
    } finally {
        if (stream != null) {
            try {
                stream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                log.error("Exception during closing file " + file.getName());
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to @cklab and @Will and all others who suggested to look in "exclusive lock" way. I just posted code here to make other interested in people use it. I believe the solution with renaming suggested by @tigran also works but pure Java solution is preferable for me.</p>

<p>P.S. Initially I used <code>FileOutputStream</code> instead of <code>RandomAccessFile</code> but it locks file being written.</p>
