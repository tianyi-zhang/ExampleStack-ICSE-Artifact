<p>I spent days trying to figure out how to achieve this and couldn't find any solution. <strong><code>You should not put a ListView inside a ScrollView</code></strong> was the common saying everywhere I searched. I didn't want to use LinearLayout or ViewGroup because I had already created the whole UI using ListView and it looked awesome to me and everyone else. It worked well except that the page didn't scroll.</p>

<p>Recently I stumbled upon a question here and thought to give this answer a try. It works flawlessly!</p>

<p>Here's the solution:</p>

<pre><code>public class Utility {
    public static void setListViewHeightBasedOnChildren(ListView listView) {
        ListAdapter listAdapter = listView.getAdapter(); 
        if (listAdapter == null) {
            // pre-condition
            return;
        }

        int totalHeight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; listAdapter.getCount(); i++) {
            View listItem = listAdapter.getView(i, null, listView);
            listItem.measure(0, 0);
            totalHeight += listItem.getMeasuredHeight();
        }

        ViewGroup.LayoutParams params = listView.getLayoutParams();
        params.height = totalHeight + (listView.getDividerHeight() * (listAdapter.getCount() - 1));
        listView.setLayoutParams(params);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just call <code>Utility.setListViewHeightBasedOnChildren(yourListView)</code> after you have assigned the adapter to your listview and you're done!</p>

<p>A big thanks to <code>DougW</code> for coming up with the answer. Here is the original link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3495908/1117338">How can I put a ListView into a ScrollView without it collapsing?</a></p>
