<p>As you have already see <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html#Configuring" rel="nofollow">here</a>, onUpdate is not called when you have a configure activity, <strong>the first time</strong> the widget is putted.</p>

<p>This is how it works : The user choose the widget is the list, and when he placed it on the spot he wants, the activity is bring on front automatically. The user can then configure what he needs. Hence, onUpdate is not called at this time ! But if later the user click on the widget, onUpdate will be called, and then you can handle the click to bring any activity on. I'm not sure you can call the configure acitivty to modifiy the widget like that, you will probably have to add code in order to make the changes work.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onUpdate(Context context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager, int[] appWidgetIds) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(context, ClassToLaunch.class);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, intent, 0);
        RemoteViews views = new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(), R.layout.widget);
        views.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.widget, pendingIntent);  

        // Push update for this widget to the home screen
        ComponentName thisWidget = new ComponentName(context, WidgetProvider.class);
        AppWidgetManager manager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance(context);
        manager.updateAppWidget(thisWidget, views);


}
</code></pre>
