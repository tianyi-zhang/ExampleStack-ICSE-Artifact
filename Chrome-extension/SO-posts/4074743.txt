<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
It didn't occur to me that you'd want it as a string.  Modified the example to do so.  It should perform slightly better than using a <code>BufferedReader</code> since we're doing the buffering ourselves.</p>

<pre><code>public String binaryFileToHexString(final String path)
    throws FileNotFoundException, IOException
{
    final int bufferSize = 512;
    final byte[] buffer = new byte[bufferSize];
    final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    // open the file
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(path);
    int bytesRead;

    // read a block
    while ((bytesRead = stream.read(buffer)) &gt; 0)
    {
        // append the block as hex
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; bytesRead; i++)
        {
            sb.append(String.format("%02X", buffer[i]));
        }
    }
    stream.close();

    return sb.toString();
}
</code></pre>
