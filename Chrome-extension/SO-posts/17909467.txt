<p>You need to have a client connect to your server, for your server to be able to accept the connection, until that happens the code will wait at that line.</p>

<p>If you run an instance of your code and then compile and run this code (while your code is also running), you will find that you get the client request accepted message, if you get an IOException due to the port, change the port in both of them to something that doesn't appear when you call <code>netstat -o</code> in cmd.</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
public class TestCon
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Socket echoSocket = null;
        PrintWriter out = null;
        BufferedReader in = null;
        try {
            echoSocket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 1337);
            out = new PrintWriter(echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(echoSocket.getInputStream()));
            out.println("Hello Server!");
            System.out.println(in.readLine());
            out.close();
            in.close();
            echoSocket.close();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Host Unknown");System.exit(1);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Couldn't get I/O for the connection.");System.exit(1);
        }
    }
}
