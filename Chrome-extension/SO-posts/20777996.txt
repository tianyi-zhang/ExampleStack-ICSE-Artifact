<p>As far as I understand, you do not know how to get proper numbers for every level. You can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExtraCredit_Bazar {

    public static void main ( String arg[] ){

       for (int i=1; i&lt;10; i += 2){
            for (int k=0; k &lt; (4 - i / 2); k++){
                 System.out.print(" ");
            }
            int number = 1;
            for (int j=0; j &lt; (i/2); j++){
                System.out.print(number);
                number *= 2;
            }
            for (int j= (i/2); j &lt; i; j++){
                System.out.print(number);
                number /= 2;
            }
            System.out.println("");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, I've split your for-loop printing '*' into two for-loops. The first one prints a number and multiplies it by two for the next iteration. Then, when the middle is reached, the second loop comes in and it divides number by two to get it smaller again.</p>
