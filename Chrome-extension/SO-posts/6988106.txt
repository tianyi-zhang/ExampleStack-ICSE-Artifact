<p>I eventually solved this by encompassing the textview inside of a LinearLayout, then setting a LayoutAnimationController to the LinearLayout.  This causes all the childs to be animated with respect to the parent container, which made the drop-down only to be rendered within the LinearLayout (which worked perfectly).  Here is the code I used for the Animation Controller and ListView:</p>

<pre><code>private void addDeleteDropAnimation() {
    AnimationSet set = new AnimationSet(true);

    Animation animation = new AlphaAnimation(0.0f, 1.0f);
    animation.setDuration(150);
    set.addAnimation(animation);

    animation = new TranslateAnimation(
        Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.0f,Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.0f,
        Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, -1.0f,Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.0f
    );
    animation.setDuration(300);
    set.addAnimation(animation);

    controllerDel = new LayoutAnimationController(set, 0.5f);
    vw_delLinearLayout.setLayoutAnimation(controllerDel);
}
</code></pre>
