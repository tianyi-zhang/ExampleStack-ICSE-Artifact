<p>Every Java program runs in a sandbox. While your OS might have 10 GB of RAM available to it your app might only have 128 MB.</p>

<p>You need to make sure you app has enough ram allocated to the JVM by using the -Xms -Xmx arguments. -Xms indicates the minimum and -Xmx the maximum</p>

<p>It's been suggested in the comments that your expectedObjectIDs seem kinda high. I would certainly check that out. However, you can use the following code to get an idea as you to memory usage and available memory. Using that info you can adjust your -Xms -Xmx accordingly.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<pre><code>Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();  

long maxMemory = runtime.maxMemory();  
long allocatedMemory = runtime.totalMemory();  
long freeMemory = runtime.freeMemory();  

System.out.println("free memory: " + freeMemory / 1024);  
System.out.println("allocated memory: " + allocatedMemory / 1024);  
System.out.println("max memory: " + maxMemory /1024);  
System.out.println("total free memory: " +   
   (freeMemory + (maxMemory - allocatedMemory)) / 1024);   
</code></pre>
