<p>To make this work there are a few different steps. Assuming your database connection is working and those are the correct columns you are looking in with your <code>Cursor</code></p>

<p>(1) Convert the blob to a <code>Bitmap</code>. You can use the blob you get back, assuming you actually downloaded and stored it to your local database, as the byte[] you will decode.</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap bm = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(tileData, 0 ,tileData.length);
</code></pre>

<p>(2) Create a new file in the approprite directory and write to that file. You can do that with something like the code below. The idea is to get the local directory </p>

<pre><code>private void storeBitmap(Bitmap myBitmap){
    String root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString();
    File myDir = new File(root + "/your_directory_name");

    String fname = "your_file_name.jpg";
    File file = new File (myDir, fname);
    if (file.exists ()) file.delete (); 
        try {
            FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);
            myBitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 90, out);
            out.flush();
            out.close();

        } catch (Exception e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to add the images to gallery or you just want a different (and potentially easier) way to add the file, look into using <code>MediaScanner</code> which will add the files as though you took the picture with your camers </p>
