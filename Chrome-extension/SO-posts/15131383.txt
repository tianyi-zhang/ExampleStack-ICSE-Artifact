<p>If you want to exit only onBackPressed() in C then all you have to do is override the onBackPressed() in activities A, B and D by doing this </p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed()
{
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will ensure that when back key is pressed in A, B and D, application doesn't close. You don't need to override onBackPressed() in activity C as Android calls finish() by default. But if you want to pop up an alert dialog then you can do as follows -</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed()
{
 // TODO Auto-generated method stub
AlertDialog.Builder alertbox = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
            alertbox.setTitle("Are you sure you want to exit the application");
            alertbox.setCancelable(false);
            alertbox.setPositiveButton("Yes", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                public void onClick(DialogInterface arg0, int arg1) {
                    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                    finish();
                }
            });

            alertbox.setNegativeButton("No", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                public void onClick(DialogInterface arg0, int arg1) {
                }
            });

            alertbox.show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally to take care that previous activities close when you try to finish the activity in C, you should call finish() whenever you start a new activity.</p>
