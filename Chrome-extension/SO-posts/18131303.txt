<p>the problem is coming from the <code>ViewFlipper</code> you're using in your adapter. </p>

<p>List views in android use view recycling (which is what the convertView is for in getView) but due to how you're handling them every time a view gets recycled you add another view to the flipper, what you need to do is add the view when convertView is null and then modify the view in the flipper to represent your data, not sure how the question card view works so I'm just guessing there.</p>

<pre><code>public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    ViewHolder holder;
    if (convertView == null) {
        convertView = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.flashcard, null);
        holder = new ViewHolder();
        holder.flipper = (ViewFlipper) convertView.findViewById(R.id.flashcard);
        holder.card = FlashCard.createQuestionCard(context,flashCardItems.get(position).getQuestion());
        holder.filpper.addView(holder.card);
        convertView.setTag(holder);
    }
    else {
        holder = (ViewHolder) convertView.getTag();
    }
    holder.card.setQuestion(flashCardItems.get(position).getQuestion());


    return convertView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>obviously you'll have to adjust your view holder and add a card field with the proper type and add a setQuestion method to the questionCard view but you get the idea.</p>
