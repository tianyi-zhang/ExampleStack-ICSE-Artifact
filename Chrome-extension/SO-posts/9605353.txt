<p>Here is an alternative. What it does is: Get which week you want (n), and the other parameters, and return the date of the day in that week. Since Calendar gives the date of the previous month (for example 29th of February instead of 7th of March, since the 1st week of March collides with last week of Feb), the function computes the 2nd week if the date goes beyond 7 or multiples of it for each week thereof. Hope that helps.</p>

<pre><code>public static int getNthWeekDay (int n, int day, int month, int year) {
    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

    calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, day);
    calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, month);
    calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH,n);
    calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year);
    if (calendar.get(Calendar.DATE) &gt; n * 7) {
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK,day);
        calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, month);
        calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH,day+1);

    }
    return calendar.get(Calendar.DATE);
}
</code></pre>
