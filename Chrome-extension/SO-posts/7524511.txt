<p>The server is likely returning an error that begins with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;BR /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can verify this by adding a line to this block of code:</p>

<pre><code>try {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(
                is, "iso-8859-1"), 8);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = null;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line + "\n");

            /////////////////////////////////
            // ADD THIS
            Log.i("log_tag","Line reads: " + line);

        }
        is.close();
        result = sb.toString();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("log_tag", "Error converting result " + e.toString());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then run the program and check your log. It will show you what information is received from the server.</p>

<p>For instance, if your PHP configuration does not include the JSON library, you will get an error. You may be using an older version of PHP. If you are using a managed server like 1and1 or GoDaddy, you may just need to edit your .htaccess file so that your site uses PHP5.</p>
