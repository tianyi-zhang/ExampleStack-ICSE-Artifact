<p>I didn't look at your whole code. . . only the getView method in your Adapter, cause that is where I suspect the problem is.</p>

<p>When the convertView is not null, you are simply returning convertView. . . this is what is causing the problem. When you do this, you are returning a view that the adapter is attempting to recycle from one gridview position to another. That's why the image from one view is appearing in another. Instead, do this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
  View grid;

  LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

      if (convertView == null) {
        grid = new View(mContext);
        grid = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_gridview_item, null);
      } else {
        grid = (View) convertView;
      }

        TextView textView = (TextView) grid.findViewById(R.id.txtItemName);
        ImageView imageView = (ImageView)grid.findViewById(R.id.imageItem);
        textView.setText(libraryItem[position]);
        imageView.setImageResource(imageId[position]);
  return grid;
}
</code></pre>
