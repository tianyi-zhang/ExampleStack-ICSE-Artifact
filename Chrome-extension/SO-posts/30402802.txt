<p>The code for the content resolver is open source: <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/content/ContentResolver.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/content/ContentResolver.java</a> if you are interested. I'm also having trouble with other things associated with the 5.0 update, which is why I happened across this post. Looks like you need to pass a valid account object to the method to get it to work. </p>

<pre><code>public static boolean isSyncActive(Account account, String authority) {
    if (account == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("account must not be null");
    }
    if (authority == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("authority must not be null");
    }

    try {
        return getContentService().isSyncActive(account, authority, null);
    } catch (RemoteException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("the ContentService should always be reachable", e);
    }
}
</code></pre>
