<p>If you want to make HTTP requests from within a Servlet you do it as you would from any process. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

  URL url = new URL("http://www.targetdomain.com/api?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2...");

  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
  conn.setConnectTimeout(5000);    // 5 seconds
  conn.setRequestMethod("GET");       
  conn.connect();
  BufferedReader rd  = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));

  String line;
  StringBuffer bf = new StringBuffer();
  while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {
      bf.append(line);
  }
  conn.disconnect(); 

  //... pass bf to an XML parser and do your processing...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on whatever XML parser you're using, you can probably skip buffering the response and putting it in a StringBuffer, and instead pass your parser the response InputStream directly.</p>
