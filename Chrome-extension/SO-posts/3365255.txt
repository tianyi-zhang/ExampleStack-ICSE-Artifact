<p>Dot product is probably more useful in this case. <a href="http://geosoft.no/software/geometry/Geometry.java.html">Here</a> you can find a geometry package for Java which provides some useful helpers. Below is their calculation for determining the angle between two 3-d points. Hopefully it will get you started:</p>

<pre><code>public static double computeAngle (double[] p0, double[] p1, double[] p2)
{
  double[] v0 = Geometry.createVector (p0, p1);
  double[] v1 = Geometry.createVector (p0, p2);

  double dotProduct = Geometry.computeDotProduct (v0, v1);

  double length1 = Geometry.length (v0);
  double length2 = Geometry.length (v1);

  double denominator = length1 * length2;

  double product = denominator != 0.0 ? dotProduct / denominator : 0.0;

  double angle = Math.acos (product);

  return angle;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck!</p>
