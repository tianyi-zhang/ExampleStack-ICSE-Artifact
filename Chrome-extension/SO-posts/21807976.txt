<p>Fields declared in interface are <code>static</code> and <strong><code>final</code></strong> (not to mention <code>public</code>), in other words they are constants which mean you can't reassign them. </p>

<p>If you want to be able to do something like</p>

<pre><code>public void resetGrid(){
    sudokuGrid = new int[][]{
        {2,4,0,6,8,0,3,0,0}, 
        {0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0}, 
        {6,5,0,0,1,0,0,8,7},
        {0,0,0,0,0,7,0,9,8},
        {9,3,2,5,0,8,7,1,4},
        {7,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0},
        {4,9,0,0,7,0,0,2,5},
        {0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0},
        {0,0,1,0,4,5,0,7,3}
    };
    drawGrid();
}
</code></pre>

<p>you should make <code>int[][] sudokuGrid</code> field in your class.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If this array has to be declared in interface then you can try reassigning its rows (they are not final). Here is example of how you can do it:</p>

<pre><code>public void resetGrid(){
    int[][] tmp = {
        {2,4,0,6,8,0,3,0,0}, 
        {0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0}, 
        {6,5,0,0,1,0,0,8,7},
        {0,0,0,0,0,7,0,9,8},
        {9,3,2,5,0,8,7,1,4},
        {7,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0},
        {4,9,0,0,7,0,0,2,5},
        {0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0},
        {0,0,1,0,4,5,0,7,3}
    };
    for (int i=0; i&lt;sudokuGrid.length; i++)
        sudokuGrid[i]=tmp[i];
    drawGrid();
}
</code></pre>
