<p>There isn't any way to do exactly that (that I'm aware of).</p>

<p>You do however have a few options:</p>

<p>1) Execute the python from within java like this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    String line;
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /c dir");
    BufferedReader bri = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
    BufferedReader bre = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));
    while ((line = bri.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
    bri.close();
    while ((line = bre.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
    bre.close();
    p.waitFor();
    System.out.println("Done.");
}
catch (Exception err) {
    err.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) You can maybe use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython" rel="nofollow">Jython</a> which is "an implementation of the Python programming language written in Java", from there you might have more luck doing what you want.</p>

<p>3) You can make the two applications communicate somehow, with a socket or shared file</p>
