<p>I know it is too much late but help for others
just go to camera manager class and paste this code on replacement of given method
it works for all types of screens</p>

<pre><code>    public Rect getFramingRect() {
    if (framingRect == null) {
    if (camera == null) {
    return null;
    }
    Point screenResolution = configManager.getScreenResolution();
    int width = screenResolution.x * 3 / 4;

    int height = screenResolution.y * 3 / 4;
    Log.v("Framing rect is : ", "width is "+width+"   and height is "+height);
    int leftOffset = (screenResolution.x - width) / 2;
    int topOffset = (screenResolution.y - height) / 2;
    framingRect = new Rect(leftOffset, topOffset, leftOffset + width, topOffset + height);
    Log.d(TAG, "Calculated framing rect: " + framingRect);
    }
    return framingRect;
   }
</code></pre>
