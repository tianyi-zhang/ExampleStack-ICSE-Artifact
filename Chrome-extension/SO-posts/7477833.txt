<p>Apparently, creating a custom exception is necessary to avoid the SEVERE log warning.  The one unanswered question I had was what to use for the Family code in that custom exception for a 501 error.</p>

<p>A quick check of the Jersey client-side code (which, curiously, does define a 501 status response) shows they determine the status code like so:</p>

<pre><code>       Status(final int statusCode, final String reasonPhrase) {
        this.code = statusCode;
        this.reason = reasonPhrase;
        switch(code/100) {
            case 1: this.family = Family.INFORMATIONAL; break;
            case 2: this.family = Family.SUCCESSFUL; break;
            case 3: this.family = Family.REDIRECTION; break;
            case 4: this.family = Family.CLIENT_ERROR; break;
            case 5: this.family = Family.SERVER_ERROR; break;
            default: this.family = Family.OTHER; break;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>That puts any 500-series errors in the Family.SERVER_ERROR category.  Just fYI</p>
