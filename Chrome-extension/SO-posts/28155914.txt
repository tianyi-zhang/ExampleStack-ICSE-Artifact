<p>You can do this without any loops if you know that the maximum is <code>1000</code>.</p>

<p>This would work with:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   
    System.out.print(" Enter a number between 0 and 1000 : ");
    int num = input.nextInt();

    int ones = num % 10;

    int tens = (num / 10) % 10 ;

    int houndreds = (num / 100) % 10;

    int answer = ones + tens + houndreds;

    System.out.print(" The sum of the digit is " + answer);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This works because you know the number is <em>between</em> 0 and 1000. But as soon as you have learned about loops, you should go back to the problem again and try to solve it with loops, since that does not limit you to a given range for the input integer.</p>
