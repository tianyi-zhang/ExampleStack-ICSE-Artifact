<p>Hey,
 I've been playing with your example a bit and debugging the JAXB code. And it seems it's something specific about UTF-8 encoding used. The escapeHandler property of <code>MarshallerImpl</code> seems to be set properly. However it's being used not in every context. If I searched for calls of <code>MarshallerImpl.createEscapeHandler()</code> I found:</p>

<pre><code>public XmlOutput createWriter( OutputStream os, String encoding ) throws JAXBException {
    // UTF8XmlOutput does buffering on its own, and
    // otherwise createWriter(Writer) inserts a buffering,
    // so no point in doing a buffering here.

    if(encoding.equals("UTF-8")) {
        Encoded[] table = context.getUTF8NameTable();
        final UTF8XmlOutput out;
        if(isFormattedOutput())
            out = new IndentingUTF8XmlOutput(os,indent,table);
        else {
            if(c14nSupport)
                out = new C14nXmlOutput(os,table,context.c14nSupport);
            else
                out = new UTF8XmlOutput(os,table);
        }
        if(header!=null)
            out.setHeader(header);
        return out;
    }

    try {
        return createWriter(
            new OutputStreamWriter(os,getJavaEncoding(encoding)),
            encoding );
    } catch( UnsupportedEncodingException e ) {
        throw new MarshalException(
            Messages.UNSUPPORTED_ENCODING.format(encoding),
            e );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in your setup the top section <code>(...equals("UTF-8")...)</code> is taken into consideration. However this one doesn't take the <code>escapeHandler</code>. However if you set the encoding to any other, the bottom part of this method is called (<code>createWriter(OutputStream, String)</code>) and this one uses <code>escapeHandler</code>, so EH plays its role.
So, adding...</p>

<pre><code>    marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_ENCODING, "ASCII");
</code></pre>

<p>makes your custom <code>CharacterEscapeHandler</code> be called.
Not really sure, but I would guess this is kind of bug in JAXB. </p>
