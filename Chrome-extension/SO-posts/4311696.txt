<p>I assume you are new to java.
And I also assume that this is a sample program, or some sort of an exercise.</p>

<p>You want to check whether a list contains an array. You are using <code>list.contains</code> which is correct.</p>

<p>The problem is how you are constructing the array.</p>

<p>In the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>   int [] f = new int [2]; 

   for(int i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
   { 
      for(int j=0; j&lt;2; j++)
      { 
         f[0] = i; 
         f[1] = j;
         list.add(f);
      }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>there is only one array you are constructing, outside the <code>for</code> loop.<br>
You are actually adding to the same array again and again.
And adding this array again and again to the list. The list will contain 4 elements, but all 4 will refer to the same array.</p>

<p>If you want the list to contain different elements, then you have to create them first:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
       { 
          for(int j=0; j&lt;2; j++)
          { 
             int [] f = new int [2]; //&lt;-- new array everytime
             f[0] = i; 
             f[1] = j;
             list.add(f);
          }
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Coming to your contains check:</p>

<p>Your check will always be false, because the list <code>G</code> will always be empty (from the code you have given) you are not adding anything to it.</p>

<p>Since <code>G.contains...</code> check will always be <code>false</code> (<code>G</code> contains nothing), all the elements will be added to <code>New</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to have some sample code to understand contains, you might want to add something to <code>G</code> first.</p>

<pre><code>       for(int i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
       {  
             int [] f = new int [2]; //&lt;-- new array everytime
             f[0] = i; 
             f[1] = i;
             G.add(f);
       }

     //G will now contain [0,0] and [1,1]

       for(int i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
       { 
          for(int j=0; j&lt;2; j++)
          { 
             int [] f = new int [2]; //&lt;-- new array everytime
             f[0] = i; 
             f[1] = j;
             if(!G.contains(f))
             {
                New.add(f); //Will add only [0,1] and [1,0]
             }
          }
      }
</code></pre>

<p>Final notes: In java, it is conventional to have lowercase variable names. 
Perhaps not very importane for a sample program, but try to have meaningful variable names. Names like <code>f</code> and <code>G</code> don't convey much.</p>
