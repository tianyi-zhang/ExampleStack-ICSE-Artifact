<p>You're not submitting a thread to the executor, you're submitting Runnables to it. Calling return in the Runnable does not cause the thread executing it to terminate. The executor is written so that it can run multiple tasks in the form of Runnables, when a Runnable finishes executing (regardless of whether it returns early or whatever) the thread continues, and gets more work from its queued-up submitted tasks.</p>

<p>Here's the code in the ThreadPoolExecutor#runWorker method. The line showing <code>task.run()</code> is where the worker thread executes the task, when your task returns then the worker's execution proceeds from there.</p>

<pre><code>final void runWorker(Worker w) {
    Thread wt = Thread.currentThread();
    Runnable task = w.firstTask;
    w.firstTask = null;
    w.unlock(); // allow interrupts
    boolean completedAbruptly = true;
    try {
        while (task != null || (task = getTask()) != null) {
            w.lock();
            // If pool is stopping, ensure thread is interrupted;
            // if not, ensure thread is not interrupted.  This
            // requires a recheck in second case to deal with
            // shutdownNow race while clearing interrupt
            if ((runStateAtLeast(ctl.get(), STOP) ||
                 (Thread.interrupted() &amp;&amp;
                  runStateAtLeast(ctl.get(), STOP))) &amp;&amp;
                !wt.isInterrupted())
                wt.interrupt();
            try {
                beforeExecute(wt, task);
                Throwable thrown = null;
                try {
                    task.run();
                } catch (RuntimeException x) {
                    thrown = x; throw x;
                } catch (Error x) {
                    thrown = x; throw x;
                } catch (Throwable x) {
                    thrown = x; throw new Error(x);
                } finally {
                    afterExecute(task, thrown);
                }
            } finally {
                task = null;
                w.completedTasks++;
                w.unlock();
            }
        }
        completedAbruptly = false;
    } finally {
        processWorkerExit(w, completedAbruptly);
    }
