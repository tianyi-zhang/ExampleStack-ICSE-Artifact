<p>I think all the previous answers are correct and have provided you with a good feedback/answers. There's more than one way to skin a cat. So, I have cleaned up your code a and remove some of the unnecessary method and I have also tested the program to make sure it works for you. Here are the the two classes for you.  </p>

<pre><code>public class Month {
    private static int numInstantiated = 0;

    public Month() {
        numInstantiated++;
        getMonthTextual(numInstantiated);
    }

    public String getMonthTextual(int monthNumber) {
        switch (monthNumber) {
        case 1:
            return "January";
        case 2:
            return "February";
        case 3:
            return "March";
        case 4:
            return "April";
        case 5:
            return "May";
        case 6:
            return "June";
        case 7:
            return "July";
        case 8:
            return "August";
        case 9:
            return "September";
        case 10:
            return "October";
        case 11:
            return "November";
        case 12:
            return "December";
        default:
            return "No month specified";
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>here is the main class:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
    public class test {
            public static void main(String[] args)
            {
                Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);
                Month m1 = new Month();
                Integer newMonth;

                //kbd.nextLine();
                System.out.print("Please enter a numeric representaion of the Month? (ex. 1 for January)");
                newMonth = kbd.nextInt();

                System.out.println("You entered: " + newMonth + ", which is the month of " +   m1.getMonthTextual(newMonth));
            }
            }
</code></pre>
