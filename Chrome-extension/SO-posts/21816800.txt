<p>One problem is that, just like you have to put "" around a String when you create it you have to put '' around a character to let the system know what it is.</p>

<pre><code>char[] charTypes = {'a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n',
'o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z','A','B','C','D','E','F',
'G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X',
'Y','Z','0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','`','~','!','@','#','$',
'%','^','&amp;','*','(',')','-','_','=','+','[','{',']','}',';',':'};
</code></pre>

<p>There seems to be a typo in your code above where you refer to i2 as i22 in several places.</p>

<p>Another issue is in the way your loop conditions are set up.  Currently:</p>

<pre><code>if(charArray[i1]==charTypes[i2] &amp;&amp; i2&lt;83 &amp;&amp; i1&lt;charArray.length-1){
</code></pre>

<p>One problem with this is that you're comparing the elements in the arrays at location i1 and i2 before you're checking to make sure they're not out of bounds.  If you change it to: </p>

<pre><code>if(i2&lt;83 &amp;&amp; i1&lt;charArray.length-1 &amp;&amp; charArray[i1]==charTypes[i2]){
</code></pre>

<p>then it will exit out of the test once it sees i1 or i2 are out bounds, before calling for their location in the array and causing an error.</p>
