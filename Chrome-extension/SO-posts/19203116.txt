<p>First, some indentation:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    int list[][][] = new int [3][5][3]; //create rows, column, units (buildings) array structure.
    int i,j,k; //assign variables for row, column and unit (building).
    int ctr = 0; //set counter.

    //create array
    for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {
        for (j=0; j&lt;5; j++) {
            for (k=0; k&lt;3; k++) {
                list[i][j][k] = ctr++;
            }
        }
    }


    for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {
        for (j=0; j&lt;5; j++) {
            for (k=0; k&lt;3; k++) {
                //Format array
                System.out.println(list[i][j][k] + " ");
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please try to structure your code like this, it's easier to read.</p>

<p>Consider what happens in the last set of loops. You want to print a newline after every row, so perhaps you will need to add further print calls outside of the inner loop ... you need a newline after printing a row. It's easy, just read this carefully.</p>
