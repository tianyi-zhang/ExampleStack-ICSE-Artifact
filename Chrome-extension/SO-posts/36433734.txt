<p>I recently had to do this EXACT same task (respond with some Code when the user turns their LOCATION setting ON) and I got it to work wonderfully (albeit in a different way than in the other users answer above) - although their method could work too.. But roughly based on my method, in your case I would simply register a <code>BroadcastListener</code> on the fly (when needed) in your Java Code using an <code>Intent</code>. Bare in mind you'll need to register for the appropriate <code>permission</code> via your <code>Manifest.xml</code> file using something like: <br><br>
<code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /&gt;</code><br>
<br>
and (assuming you've registered the <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> already in one way or another), something along these lines would be placed in your Receiver: <br>
<br></p>

<pre><code>// START OF onReceive METHOD FOR RECEIVER
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

    boolean isGpsEnabled;
    boolean isNetworkEnabled;

    LocationManager locationManager = (LocationManager) context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);

    isGpsEnabled = locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER);
    isNetworkEnabled = locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER);



    // PRIMARY RECEIVER RESPONSE (FOR "PROVIDERS_CHANGED" INTENT-FILTER)
    if (intent.getAction().matches("android.location.PROVIDERS_CHANGED")) {

        Toast.makeText(context, "GPS Enabled: " + isGpsEnabled + " NetworkLocation Enabled: " + isNetworkEnabled, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();

        // START ANOTHER ACTIVITY WHEN GPS IS ENABLED IF YOU WANT
        if (isGpsEnabled) {

            Intent startNextActivity = new Intent(context, YourNextActivity.class);

            // THIS IS NEEDED IF CALLING ACTIVITY FROM OUTSIDE ACTIVITY
            startNextActivity.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);

            context.startActivity(startNextActivity);

        }

    }

}
</code></pre>

Hope this helps you out!<br>
Best wishes, and happy coding!<br>
