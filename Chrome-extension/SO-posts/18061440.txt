<p>The getView in WeekAdapter has a param parent that was never used.</p>

<pre><code>   public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
       WeekView weekView = null;
        if (convertView != null) {
            weekView = (WeekView) convertView;
        } else {
            weekView = new WeekView(mContext);
            android.widget.AbsListView.LayoutParams params =
                new android.widget.AbsListView.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
                        LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
            weekView.setLayoutParams(params);
            weekView.setClickable(true);
            weekView.setOnTouchListener(this);
        }

        int selectedWeekDay = (mSelectedWeek == position) ? mSelectedDate.get(
                Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK) : -1;
        weekView.init(position, selectedWeekDay, mFocusedMonth);

        return weekView;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Looking forward the answer.</p>
