<p>If you are not too commited to attaching a csv file, it is really easy to just dump a big string into the body of an email, and send it to someone.  You don't have the issue of writing a local file and attaching it.</p>

<p>When sending an email you can just add:</p>

<p>emailIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, emailBody); </p>

<p>where emailBody is a big string that has your data in it.  </p>

<p>At least this might be an interim solution?</p>

<p>Here is a little code that can send an email with a big string of text in it.</p>

<pre><code>              String emailSubject = " Sent from my Android";
        String emailBody = "";


        // create a big String that has your data in it called emailBody

        Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        i.setType("text/plain");

                           // send it to yourself for testing
        // i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL , new
        // String[]{"myemailaddress@fortesting.com"});

        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, emailSubject);
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, emailBody);

        try {
            startActivity(Intent.createChooser(i, "Send mail..."));
        } catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex) {
            Toast.makeText(HistoryActivity.this,
                    "There are no email clients installed.",
                    Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
</code></pre>
