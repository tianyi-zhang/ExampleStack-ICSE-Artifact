<p>Use Fused Location Provider APIs in conjunction with GoogleApiClient. You can find the apis <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderApi.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. They are designed to give locations with high accuracy. Use it using GoogleApiClient.</p>

<pre><code>new GoogleApiClient.Builder(context)
         .addApi(LocationServices.API)
         .addConnectionCallbacks(this)
         .addOnConnectionFailedListener(this)
         .build()
</code></pre>

<p>There are other approaches to using location providers. You should not restrict yourself to locations obtained using GPS and Mobile Network. Rather iterate over all the location providers and depending on your accuracy requirement choose those which give you high accuracy. The following code does this:</p>

<pre><code>    Location bestResult = null;
    float bestAccuracy = Float.MAX_VALUE;
    long bestAge = Long.MIN_VALUE;
    List&lt;String&gt; matchingProviders = mLocationManager.getAllProviders();

    for (String provider : matchingProviders) {

        Location location = mLocationManager.getLastKnownLocation(provider);

        if (location != null) {

            float accuracy = location.getAccuracy();
            long time = location.getTime();

            if (accuracy &lt; bestAccuracy) {

                bestResult = location;
                bestAccuracy = accuracy;
                bestAge = time;

            }
        }
    }

    // Return best reading or null
    if (bestAccuracy &gt; minAccuracy
            || (System.currentTimeMillis() - bestAge) &gt; maxAge) {
        return null;
    } else {
        return bestResult;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the location object directly after checking them for accuracy. You should take advantage of the locations accessed by other apps and not just rely on the locations obtained by GPS/Mobile Networks.</p>

<p>If you want to continuously listen to location updates implement the Locationlistener callbacks to continuously get location updates.</p>
