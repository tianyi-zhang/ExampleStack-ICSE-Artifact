<p>Here is a modification of Gopi's answer that doesn't have the line ending problem and is also more effective as it doesn't need temporary String objects for every line and avoids the redundant copying in BufferedReader and the extra work in readLine().</p>

<pre><code>public static String convertStreamToString( InputStream is, String ecoding ) throws IOException
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder( Math.max( 16, is.available() ) );
    char[] tmp = new char[ 4096 ];

    try {
       InputStreamReader reader = new InputStreamReader( is, ecoding );
       for( int cnt; ( cnt = reader.read( tmp ) ) &gt; 0; )
            sb.append( tmp, 0, cnt );
    } finally {
        is.close();
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
</code></pre>
