<p>The device screen resolution has a different aspect ratio than the device's camera resolution. If you choose the preview to have the same aspect ratio as the camera's aspect ratio, then the jpeg byte array data will not be "bugged".
The problem with this is that the preview is going to be distorted because it doesn't match the screen's aspet ratio.
Here is some code I used to find the optimal aspect ratio:</p>

<pre><code>private Size getOptimalPreviewSize(List&lt;Size&gt; sizes, int width, int height) 
{            
    Size optimalSize = null;                                 

    double targetRatio = (double) width / height;
    int Max = 0;

    for (Size size : sizes) 
    { 
        double ratio = (double) size.width / size.height;
        int m = size.width * size.height;
        if (m&gt;Max &amp;&amp; (ratio == targetRatio)) 
        {
            Max = m;
            optimalSize = size; 
        }                
    } 

    if (optimalSize == null) 
    { 
        // TODO : Backup in case we don't get a size. 
    } 

    return optimalSize; 
}
</code></pre>
