<p>I still don't know why the "setParams" doesn't work. But I used Wireshark to check my outgoing request, and after that I found a solution using HttpEntity (just as in the commented part above):</p>

<pre><code>HttpEntity myEntity = new StringEntity(message);
httpPost.setEntity(myEntity);

response = httpClient.execute(httpPost);
</code></pre>

<p>The server side I found out thanks to <a href="http://osdir.com/ml/java.jetty.general/2004-07/msg00038.html" rel="nofollow">Chris' answer</a>, only that I, of course, replaced the byte buffer with a char buffer, like <a href="http://www.kodejava.org/examples/266.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>private String getInputString() throws IOException
{
    InputStream is = request.getInputStream();
    if (is != null)
    {

        Writer writer = new StringWriter();

        char[] buffer = new char[request.getContentLength()];

        try
        {
            Reader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "UTF-8"));

            int n;
            while ((n = reader.read(buffer)) != -1)
            {
                writer.write(buffer, 0, n);
            }
        }
        finally
        {
            is.close();
        }
        return writer.toString();
    }
    else
    {
        return "";
    }
}
</code></pre>
