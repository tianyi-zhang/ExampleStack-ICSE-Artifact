<p><code>during the scrolling of ListView</code> <strong>findViewById()</strong> <code>(which layout's children is inflated for a row of listview)</code> is called frequently, which can slow down performance. Even when the Adapter returns an inflated view for <code>recycling</code>, you still need to <code>look up the elements and update them</code>. A way around repeated use of findViewById() is to use the <code>view holder design pattern</code>.</p>

<p>A ViewHolder object stores each of the <code>component views inside the tag field of the Layout</code>, so you can <code>immediately access them without the need to look them up repeatedly</code>. First, you need to create a class to hold your exact set of views.</p>

<p>Here is the class in your code</p>

<pre><code>static class WeatherHolder {
        ImageView imgIcon;
        TextView txtTitle;
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes it is manually created by us
  in <code>getView()</code> u will create <code>Object</code> of that class and access it</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code> @Override
    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        View row = convertView;
        WeatherHolder holder = null;

        if(row == null)
        {
            LayoutInflater inflater = ((Activity)context).getLayoutInflater();
            row = inflater.inflate(layoutResourceId, parent, false);

            holder = new WeatherHolder();
            holder.imgIcon = (ImageView)row.findViewById(R.id.imgIcon);
            holder.txtTitle = (TextView)row.findViewById(R.id.txtTitle);

            row.setTag(holder);
        }
        else
        {
            holder = (WeatherHolder)row.getTag();
        }
//do ur staff
return row;
}
</code></pre>
