<p><code>static int dayCounter(int dayNumber) {</code> states that you are going to return an value of type int, however what you are actually returning is <code>dayName</code> which is of type string. Change the method definition to:
<code>static String dayCounter(int dayNumber){</code></p>

<p>You will also want to update your switch case as there are no <code>break</code> statements and so your values fall through.
