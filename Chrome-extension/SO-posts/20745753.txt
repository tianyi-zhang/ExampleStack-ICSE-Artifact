<p>Many people suffered this problem, I would suggest you to store as a text file with UTF-8 and store it in sql. then retrieve them as well. no big conversation needed.</p>

<p>and if you don't know how to read text file. for instance SDCard</p>

<pre><code> //Find the directory for the SD Card using the API
 //*Don't* hardcode "/sdcard"
 File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();

 //Get the text file
 File file = new File(sdcard,"file.txt");

 //Read text from file
 StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

 try {
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
     String line;

     while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        text.append(line);
        text.append('\n');
     }
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
     //You'll need to add proper error handling here
 }

 //Find the view by its id
 TextEdit tv = (TextEdit)findViewById(R.id.text_view);

 //Set the text
 tv.setText(text);
</code></pre>
