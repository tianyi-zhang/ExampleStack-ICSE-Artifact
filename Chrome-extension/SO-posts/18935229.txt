<p>I ran into the same issue. (Dear Eclipse Community: Is it so hard to fix that bug?)
As everyone else I need the IDE for dev/debug and standalone for running.</p>

<p>So I wrote this method:</p>

<pre><code>private static String readPwd() throws IOException {
    Console c=System.console();
    if (c==null) { //IN ECLIPSE IDE
        System.out.print("Password: ");
        InputStream in=System.in;
        int max=50;
        byte[] b=new byte[max];

        int l= in.read(b);
        l--;//last character is \n
        if (l&gt;0) {
            byte[] e=new byte[l];
            System.arraycopy(b,0, e, 0, l);
            return new String(e);
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    } else { //Outside Eclipse IDE
        return new String(c.readPassword("Password: "));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Downside of this workaround is that in Eclipse you are going to see the password during the runtime of the program.</p>
