<p>Not a bug. Looking at the javadoc of the source code (
java.text.DateFormatSymbols), it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Month strings. For example: "January", "February", etc. <strong>An array of
  13 strings (some calendars have 13 months),</strong> indexed by
  Calendar.JANUARY, Calendar.FEBRUARY, etc.</p>

<pre><code>String months[] = null;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, <code>getWeekdays()</code> method returns 8 values and so on.</p>

<pre><code>public final static int JANUARY = 0;
public final static int FEBRUARY = 1;
public final static int MARCH = 2;
public final static int APRIL = 3;
public final static int MAY = 4;
public final static int JUNE = 5;
public final static int JULY = 6;
public final static int AUGUST = 7;
public final static int SEPTEMBER = 8;
public final static int OCTOBER = 9;
public final static int NOVEMBER = 10;
public final static int DECEMBER = 11;
public final static int UNDECIMBER = 12;
</code></pre>

<p>The API describes <code>UNDECIMBER</code> as: <em>field indicating the thirteenth month of the year. Although GregorianCalendar does not use this value, lunar calendars do.</em></p>

<p>Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar" rel="nofollow">here</a> for such calendars.</p>
