<p>Alright well here is the final method it's the same method i pastebinned before which i actually got from the stackoverflow topic in the link @Qwe posted before but i added the path variable so that it could add files to folders inside the zip</p>

<p>Alright so now how to use it in my example above i wanted to add a file into a folder that was inside another folder i would do that using my setup in the question like this</p>

<pre><code>private void addFilesToZip(File source, File[] files, String path){
    try{
        File tmpZip = File.createTempFile(source.getName(), null);
        tmpZip.delete();
        if(!source.renameTo(tmpZip)){
            throw new Exception("Could not make temp file (" + source.getName() + ")");
        }
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        ZipInputStream zin = new ZipInputStream(new FileInputStream(tmpZip));
        ZipOutputStream out = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(source));
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++){
            InputStream in = new FileInputStream(files[i]);
            out.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(path + files[i].getName()));
            for(int read = in.read(buffer); read &gt; -1; read = in.read(buffer)){
                out.write(buffer, 0, read);
            }
            out.closeEntry();
            in.close();
        }
        for(ZipEntry ze = zin.getNextEntry(); ze != null; ze = zin.getNextEntry()){
            if(!zipEntryMatch(ze.getName(), files, path)){
                out.putNextEntry(ze);
                for(int read = zin.read(buffer); read &gt; -1; read = zin.read(buffer)){
                    out.write(buffer, 0, read);
                }
                out.closeEntry();
            }
        }
        out.close();
        tmpZip.delete();
    }catch(Exception e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

private boolean zipEntryMatch(String zeName, File[] files, String path){
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++){
        if((path + files[i].getName()).equals(zeName)){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the link ended up being able to improve that method a bit so that it could add in files that weren't in the root and now i'm a happy camper :) hope this helps someone else out as well</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I worked a bit more on the method so that it could not only append to the zip but it also is able to update files within the zip</p>

<p>Use the method like this</p>

<pre><code>File[] files = {new File("/path/to/file/to/update/in")};
addFilesToZip(new File("/path/to/zip"), files, "folder/dir/");
</code></pre>

<p>You wouldn't start the path (last variable) with / as that's not how it's listed in the zip entries</p>
