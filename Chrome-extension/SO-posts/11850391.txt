<p>There are two problems here.  First, out.write does not insert a newline at the end of each call, you have to do that manually. So what is happening is when you do the readline in the cal to parse the Boolean you are actually consuming ALL the data in the file.  Second, you need to flush and close the file before leaving that function to be sure you do not leave any data in the buffers.</p>

<p>Here is save rewritten that should work:</p>

<pre><code>public static void save(FileIO files) {
BufferedWriter out = null;
try {
    out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(
            files.writeFile(".mrnom")));
    out.write(Boolean.toString(soundEnabled));
    out.write("\n");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        out.write(Integer.toString(highscores[i]));
        out.write("\n");

    }
    out.flush();
    out.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
} finally {
    try {
        if (out != null)
            out.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {

    }
}
}
</code></pre>
