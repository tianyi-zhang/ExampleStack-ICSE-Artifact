<p>I found out how to get the remote HEAD (FETCH_HEAD).
Now my Code is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>git.fetch().call();
Repository repo = git.getRepository();      
ObjectId fetchHead = repo.resolve("FETCH_HEAD^{tree}");
ObjectId head = repo.resolve("HEAD^{tree}");

ObjectReader reader = repo.newObjectReader();
CanonicalTreeParser oldTreeIter = new CanonicalTreeParser();
oldTreeIter.reset(reader, head);
CanonicalTreeParser newTreeIter = new CanonicalTreeParser();
newTreeIter.reset(reader, fetchHead);
List&lt;DiffEntry&gt; diffs= git.diff().setShowNameAndStatusOnly(true)
                        .setNewTree(newTreeIter)
                        .setOldTree(oldTreeIter)
                        .call();
for(DiffEntry entry : diffs) {
    System.out.println(entry.toString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>It shows me remote changes like I wanted, but it works not correct. If I create a new File in my working-copy and commit the file (without to push), then the diff show me that the new file is deleted in the FETCH_HEAD.
How can I filter this false delete messages?</p>
