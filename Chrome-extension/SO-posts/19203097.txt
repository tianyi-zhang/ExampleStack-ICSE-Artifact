<p>You need to print new lines in between, using <code>System.out.println()</code>. Also, <code>println()</code> always prints a new line (as if pressing Enter) after the string. There's also <code>System.out.print()</code>, which doesn't put a new line after it.</p>

<p>Think about when you need the new lines. After every row or column? Perhaps an extra one after every set to make an empty line.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've indented your code properly. It'll be a bit easier to see where to add code then.</p>

<pre><code>int list[][][] = new int [3][5][3]; //create rows, column, units (buildings) array structure.
int i,j,k; //assign variables for row, column and unit (building).
int ctr = 0; //set counter.

//create array
for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) {
    for (j=0; j&lt;5; j++) {
        for (k=0; k&lt;3; k++) {
            list[i][j][k] = ctr++;
        }
    }
}


for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++) { //Prints 3 sections.
    for (j=0; j&lt;5; j++) { //Prints 5 rows.
        for (k=0; k&lt;3; k++) { //Prints 3 columns.
            //Format array
            System.out.println(list[i][j][k] + " ");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
