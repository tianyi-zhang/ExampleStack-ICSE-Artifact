<p>you can use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/ListPopupWindow.html">ListPopupWindow</a>, submitting your custom adapter, through which you can control the layout of every single row of the <code>ListPopupWindow</code>. As for a normal <code>PopupWindow</code> you have to provide an anchor view and additionally you have to call  <code>setContentWidth</code> on the instance of <code>ListPopupWindow</code>, which sets  the width of the popup window by the size of its content. It is a small price you have to pay, but for a small dataset is not a big deal. I have this utility method to retrieve the max width of the row:</p>

<pre><code>public int measureContentWidth(ListAdapter adapter) {
    int maxWidth = 0;
    int count = adapter.getCount();
    final int widthMeasureSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0, MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED);
    final int heightMeasureSpec = MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0, MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED);
    View itemView = null;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
        itemView = adapter.getView(i, itemView, this);
        itemView.measure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
        maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, itemView.getMeasuredWidth());
    }
    return maxWidth;
}
</code></pre>
