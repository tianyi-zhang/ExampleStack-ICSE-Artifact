<p>I was able to fix the problem, and found an easy solution that works great on both the Atrix and the HTC One.  I don't know WHY it works (any insight on that would be greatly appreciated), but here is what I did.  </p>

<p>All I did was change my BufferElements2Rec constant from 1024 to 512.  The constant is used in the code below.  I guess a smaller buffer size allowed it to work properly.</p>

<p>This is my writeAudioDataToFile() function called inside the recording thread:</p>

<pre><code>private void writeAudioDataToFile() throws IOException 
{
    //create filename
    filePath = generateFilePath();

    //start writing data
    short sData[] = new short[BufferElements2Rec];

    FileOutputStream os = null;
    try {
        os = new FileOutputStream(filePath);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    byte[] headerBytes = writeWAVHeader(1);
    os.write(headerBytes, 0, headerBytes.length);
    while (isRecording)
    {
        // gets the voice output from microphone to byte format

        recorder.read(sData, 0, BufferElements2Rec);
        System.out.println("Recording audio to file" + sData.toString());
        try {
            // // writes the data to file from buffer
            byte bData[] = short2byte(sData);
            os.write(bData, 0, BufferElements2Rec * BytesPerElement);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    try {
        os.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

}
</code></pre>
