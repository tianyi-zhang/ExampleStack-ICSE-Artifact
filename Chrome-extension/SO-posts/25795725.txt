<p>Assuming that I'm not 'missing something' - that the function is missing - it is simple to just copy json.org's version of the missing function.</p>

<p>You can't substitute json.org's implementation in place of course, since the package names would clash, but you can stick their implementation of the missing function somewhere in your code.  Note that I editing it to remove testValidity which is also missing from Android, and add the 'subject'.</p>

<pre><code>public static JSONObject append( JSONObject subject, String key, java.lang.Object value) throws JSONException {
    Object object = subject.opt(key);
    if (object == null) {
        subject.put(key, new JSONArray().put(value));
    } else if (object instanceof JSONArray) {
        subject.put(key, ((JSONArray) object).put(value));
    } else {
        throw new JSONException("JSONObject[" + key + "] is not a JSONArray.");
    }
    return subject;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that they have their own, permissive, license, excepting that you can't use it for evil!</p>
