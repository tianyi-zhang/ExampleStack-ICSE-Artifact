<p>You don't need to "copy" file to sdcard in order to read it. </p>

<p>And anyway, using "cat" for copying is not what you want in application. As you loose all control over the operation; error detection and handling becomes much harder.</p>

<p>Just use <code>FileReader</code> and <code>BufferedReader</code>. An example can be found <a href="http://www.kodejava.org/examples/28.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Here is a copy:</p>

<pre><code>File file = new File("test.txt");
StringBuffer contents = new StringBuffer();
BufferedReader reader = null;

try {
    reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
    String text = null;

    // repeat until all lines is read
    while ((text = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        contents.append(text)
            .append(System.getProperty(
                "line.separator"));
    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    try {
        if (reader != null) {
            reader.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}           

Log.e("TEXT", contents.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>All this is very basic stuff. You should consider reading some Java related book or a few articles.</p>
