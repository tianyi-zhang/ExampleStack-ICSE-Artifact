<p>Firstly you have to look for the three rows and the three columns if they are filled.
After that you have to check the two diagonals.
Additionally, I recommend passing the player variable throught the <strong>boardFilled</strong> method for a cleaner code!</p>

<p>This method will replace your methods <strong>boardFilled</strong>, <strong>rowFilled</strong> and <strong>CheckRows</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>boolean boardFilled(int player) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    if (board[i][0] == player &amp;&amp; board[i][1] == player &amp;&amp; board[i][2] == player) {
      return true;
    }

    if (board[0][i] == player &amp;&amp; board[1][i] == player &amp;&amp; board[2][i] == player) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  if (board[0][0] == player &amp;&amp; board[1][1] == player &amp;&amp; board[2][2] == player) {
      return true;
  }

  if (board[0][2] == player &amp;&amp; board[1][1] == player &amp;&amp; board[2][0] == player) {
      return true;
  }

  return false;
}
</code></pre>
