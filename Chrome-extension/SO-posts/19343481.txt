<p>This code inflates a new view, settings it's contents. This means that you're creating a new view programatically. It's often used i.e. when populating a list, where you'll have number of rows, each identical in structure, but with different values.</p>

<p>Here is how it works:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public View getView(int i, View view, ViewGroup viewGroup) {
    // Get the inflater service
    LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

    // Inflate view with ID = R.layout.single_row into the row variable
    View row = inflater.inflate(R.layout.single_row, viewGroup,false);

    // Get child views of row: title, description and image.
    TextView title = (TextView) row.findViewById(R.id.txtTitle);
    TextView description = (TextView) row.findViewById(R.id.txtDescription);
    ImageView image = (ImageView) row.findViewById(R.id.imgPic);

    // This get's some template view which will provide data: title, description and image
    SingleRow temp = list.get(i);

    // Here you're setting title, description and image by using values from `temp`.
    title.setText(temp.title);
    description.setText(temp.description);
    image.setImageResource(temp.image);

    // Return the view with all values set. This view will be later probably added somewhere as a child (maybe into a list?)
    return row;
}
</code></pre>
