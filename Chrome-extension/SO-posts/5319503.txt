<p>You could read the <code>/proc/net/arp</code> file to read all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" rel="nofollow">ARP</a> entries. See the example in the blog post <em><a href="http://www.flattermann.net/2011/02/android-howto-find-the-hardware-mac-address-of-a-remote-host/" rel="nofollow">Android: Howto find the hardware MAC address of a remote host</a></em>. In the ARP table, search for all the hosts that belong to your Wi-Fi network based on the IP address.</p>

<p>Here is example code, which counts the number of hosts connected to the AP. This code assumes that one ARP entry is for the phone connected to the network and the remaining ones are from hosts connected to the AP.</p>

<pre><code>private int countNumMac()
{
    int macCount = 0;
    BufferedReader br = null;
    try {
        br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/proc/net/arp"));
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            String[] splitted = line.split(" +");
            if (splitted != null &amp;&amp; splitted.length &gt;= 4) {
                // Basic sanity check
                String mac = splitted[3];
                if (mac.matches("..:..:..:..:..:..")) {
                    macCount++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    finally {
        try {
            br.close();
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    if (macCount == 0)
        return 0;
    else
        return macCount-1; //One MAC address entry will be for the host.
}
</code></pre>
