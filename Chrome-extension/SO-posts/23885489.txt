<p><code>Why did it worked only after I upgraded the version number not even when I erased all the app related data?</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p>As soon as you start working with either  of <code>getReadableDatabase()</code> ,<code>getWriteableDatabase()</code> or any other <code>SQLiteHelper</code> class code. The first method calls is <code>onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db)</code> which creates Database under your application database path
<code>/data/data/PACKAGE_NAME/databases/tmc</code> (in your case).</p></li>
<li><p>If you modify your Database structure in <code>SQliteHelper</code> the first method get called is <code>onUpgrage()</code> which checks whether <code>Database_Version</code> get modified or not. If it's then it execute <code>onUpgrade()</code> with series of <code>DROP TABLE IF EXIST</code> followed by <code>onCreate()</code> which again create your database with new structure under your application path by replacing your previous database file.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearing Cached data using Application Manager indeed clear database and cached data of that application. But SQLiteHelper did check for <code>Database_Version</code> with old and new one. If new one is greater than old one. It does call <code>onUpgrage()</code> followed by <code>onCreate()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you intent to use Database with Android Application it get store under <code>/data/data/PACKAGE_NAME/databases/tmc</code> with application process security. Unable to access database file unless you have rooted Android device in which you already have.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>One can create <code>Developer Options</code> or anything you like just to pull database from your application process to SD Card for unrooted devices.</p>

<p><code>Copy database file from application process path to SD Card for unrooted devices.</code></p>

<pre><code>try {
       File sd = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
       File data = Environment.getDataDirectory();
        if (sd.canWrite()) {
        String currentDBPath = "/data/data/" + getPackageName() + "/databases/ZnameDB"; //Your DATABASE_NAME
        String backupDBPath = "ZnameDB_Dev.db"; //DATABASE_COPY_NAME UNDER SDCARD
        File currentDB = new File(currentDBPath);
        File backupDB = new File(sd, backupDBPath);
        if (currentDB.exists()) {
        FileChannel src = new FileInputStream(currentDB).getChannel();
        FileChannel dst = new FileOutputStream(backupDB).getChannel();
        dst.transferFrom(src, 0, src.size());
        src.close();
        dst.close();
        Toast.makeText(SettingsActivity.this, "Database Transfered!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
          }
         }
     } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, e.toString());
    }
</code></pre>
