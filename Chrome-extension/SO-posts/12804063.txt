<p>I was using something along the lines of the currently accepted answer in order to send emails with an attached binary error log file. GMail and K-9 send it just fine and it also arrives fine on my mail server. The only problem was my mail client of choice Thunderbird which had troubles with opening / saving the attached log file. In fact it simply didn't save the file at all without complaining.</p>

<p>I took a look at one of these mail's source codes and noticed that the log file attachment had (understandably) the mime type <code>message/rfc822</code>. Of course that attachment is not an attached email. But Thunderbird cannot cope with that tiny error gracefully. So that was kind of a bummer.</p>

<p>After a bit of research and experimenting I came up with the following solution:</p>

<pre><code>    public Intent createEmailOnlyChooserIntent(Intent source,
        CharSequence chooserTitle) {
        Stack&lt;Intent&gt; intents = new Stack&lt;Intent&gt;();
        Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SENDTO, Uri.fromParts("mailto",
                "info@domain.com", null));
        List&lt;ResolveInfo&gt; activities = getPackageManager()
                .queryIntentActivities(i, 0);

        for(ResolveInfo ri : activities) {
            Intent target = new Intent(source);
            target.setPackage(ri.activityInfo.packageName);
            intents.add(target);
        }

        if(!intents.isEmpty()) {
            Intent chooserIntent = Intent.createChooser(intents.remove(0),
                    chooserTitle);
            chooserIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_INITIAL_INTENTS,
                    intents.toArray(new Parcelable[intents.size()]));

            return chooserIntent;
        } else {
            return Intent.createChooser(source, chooserTitle);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It can be used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        i.setType("*/*");
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.fromFile(crashLogFile));
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, new String[] {
            ANDROID_SUPPORT_EMAIL
        });
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Crash report");
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "Some crash report details");

        startActivity(createEmailOnlyChooserIntent(i, "Send via email"));
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the createEmailOnlyChooserIntent method can be easily fed with the correct intent and the correct mime type.</p>

<p>It then goes through the list of available activities that respond to an ACTION_SENDTO <code>mailto</code> protocol intent (which are email apps only) and constructs a chooser based on that list of activities and the original ACTION_SEND intent with the correct mime type.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that Skype is not listed anymore (which happens to respond to the rfc822 mime type).</p>
