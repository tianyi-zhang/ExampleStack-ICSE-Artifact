<p>I got it. Seems, like my http-/content-headers were messed up. The proper headers should be:</p>

<pre><code>stream.write(("HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n" +
                          "Server: iRecon\r\n" +
                          "Connection: close\r\n" +
                          "Max-Age: 0\r\n" +
                          "Expires: 0\r\n" +
                          "Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0\r\n" +
                          "Pragma: no-cache\r\n" + 
                          "Content-Type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; " +
                          "boundary=" + boundary + "\r\n" +
                          "\r\n" +
                          "--" + boundary + "\r\n").getBytes());
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>stream.write(("Content-type: image/jpeg\r\n" +
                      "Content-Length: " + buffer.size() + "\r\n" +
                      "X-Timestamp:" + timestamp + "\r\n" +
                      "\r\n").getBytes());

buffer.writeTo(stream);
stream.write(("\r\n--" + boundary + "\r\n").getBytes());
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, where to put the boundary is your own choice. Also there are probably some fields which are optional (e.g. most in Cache-Control), but this works and till now I was too lazy to strip them down. The important part is to remember the linebreaks (<code>\r\n</code> thingies)...</p>
