<p>I would recoment to use the already given functionality of the Group. Every Stage has an root Group and this implements the lookup for an actor by name. The code for it is more secure than the given inside of the answer in case you use the Grouping system. </p>

<p>The code of the Group looks like this and is more secure because it also looks inside of a group if you add a group to the stage.</p>

<pre><code>    /** Returns the first actor found with the specified name. Note this recursively compares the name of every actor in the group. */
    public Actor findActor (String name) {
            Array&lt;Actor&gt; children = this.children;
            for (int i = 0, n = children.size; i &lt; n; i++)
                    if (name.equals(children.get(i).getName())) return children.get(i);
            for (int i = 0, n = children.size; i &lt; n; i++) {
                    Actor child = children.get(i);
                    if (child instanceof Group) {
                            Actor actor = ((Group)child).findActor(name);
                            if (actor != null) return actor;
                    }
            }
            return null;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to search alot of times to hold an refrence of the Actor. If not just use the serch method.</p>
