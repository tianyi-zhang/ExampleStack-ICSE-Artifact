<p>I'm new in Android so I was stuck even with the clues given in the answer above.. went to search around and found this code somewhere in the sea of Google. Hope it helps someone.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Returns true if the given Activity has hardware acceleration enabled
 * in its manifest, or in its foreground window.
 *
 * TODO(husky): Remove when initialize() is refactored (see TODO there)
 * TODO(dtrainor) This is still used by other classes.  Make sure to pull some version of this
 * out before removing it.
 */
public static boolean hasHardwareAcceleration(Activity activity) {
    // Has HW acceleration been enabled manually in the current window?
    Window window = activity.getWindow();
    if (window != null) {
        if ((window.getAttributes().flags
                &amp; WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED) != 0) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // Has HW acceleration been enabled in the manifest?
    try {
        ActivityInfo info = activity.getPackageManager().getActivityInfo(
                activity.getComponentName(), 0);
        if ((info.flags &amp; ActivityInfo.FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED) != 0) {
            return true;
        }
    } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
        Log.e("Chrome", "getActivityInfo(self) should not fail");
    }

    return false;
}
</code></pre>
