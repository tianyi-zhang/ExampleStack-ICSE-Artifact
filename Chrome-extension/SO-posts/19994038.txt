<p>I don't get what you means, but i think you are looking for this, MD5.</p>

<p>To check MD5 of a file, you can use this code</p>

<pre><code>public String getMd5(File file)
{
    DigestInputStream stream = null;
    try
    {
        stream = new DigestInputStream(new FileInputStream(file), MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5"));
        byte[] buffer = new byte[65536];

        read = stream.read(buffer);
        while (read &gt;= 1) {
        read = stream.read(buffer);
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ignored)
    {
        int read;
        return null;
    }
    return String.format("%1$032x", new Object[] { new BigInteger(1, stream.getMessageDigest().digest()) });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can store the md5 of a file in any way for exmaple XML. An exmaple of MD5 is <code>49e6d7e2967d1a471341335c49f46c6c</code> so once the file name and size change, md5 will change. You can store md5 of each file in XML format and next time your run a code to check md5 and compare the md5 of each file in the xml file.</p>
