<p>Starting from @Barend 's suggestion, following is my final version with minor modifications :</p>

<pre><code>private static final char NEWLINE = '\n';
private static final String SPACE_SEPARATOR = " ";
//if text has \n, \r or \t symbols it's better to split by \s+
private static final String SPLIT_REGEXP= "\\s+";

public static String breakLines(String input, int maxLineLength) {
    String[] tokens = input.split(SPLIT_REGEXP);
    StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder(input.length());
    int lineLen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; tokens.length; i++) {
        String word = tokens[i];

        if (lineLen + (SPACE_SEPARATOR + word).length() &gt; maxLineLength) {
            if (i &gt; 0) {
                output.append(NEWLINE);
            }
            lineLen = 0;
        }
        if (i &lt; tokens.length - 1 &amp;&amp; (lineLen + (word + SPACE_SEPARATOR).length() + tokens[i + 1].length() &lt;=
                maxLineLength)) {
            word += SPACE_SEPARATOR;
        }
        output.append(word);
        lineLen += word.length();
    }
    return output.toString();
}

System.out.println(breakLines("THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE (the Terms) ARE A     LEGAL AND BINDING " +
                "AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC governing     your use of this site, " +
