<p>In addition to Umriyaev's answer:</p>

<p>If only the hue is needed, it is not required to divide the 0-255 ranged colours with 255.
The result of e.x. (green - blue) / (max - min) will be the same for any range (as long as the colours are in the same range of course).</p>

<p>Here is the java example to get the Hue:  </p>

<pre><code>public int getHue(int red, int green, int blue) {

    float min = Math.min(Math.min(red, green), blue);
    float max = Math.max(Math.max(red, green), blue);

    float hue = 0f;
    if (max == red) {
        hue = (green - blue) / (max - min);

    } else if (max == green) {
        hue = 2f + (blue - red) / (max - min);

    } else {
        hue = 4f + (red - green) / (max - min);
    }

    hue = hue * 60;
    if (hue &lt; 0) hue = hue + 360;

    return Math.round(hue);
}
</code></pre>
