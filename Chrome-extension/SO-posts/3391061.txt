<p>OH, yes, it does.
I was using it wrong, thanks for pointing it out to me. 
(Sorry for the useless question)
Here is the end code (heavily based on the one linked) since it may help someone:</p>

<pre><code>public Bitmap toGrayscale(Bitmap bmpOriginal)
{        
    int width, height;
    height = bmpOriginal.getHeight();
    width = bmpOriginal.getWidth();    

    Bitmap bmpGrayscale = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
    Canvas c = new Canvas(bmpGrayscale);
    Paint paint = new Paint();
    ColorMatrix cm = new ColorMatrix();
    cm.setSaturation(0);
    ColorMatrixColorFilter f = new ColorMatrixColorFilter(cm);
    paint.setColorFilter(f);
    c.drawBitmap(bmpOriginal, 0, 0, paint);
    return bmpGrayscale;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any remarks or comments on it are very welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
