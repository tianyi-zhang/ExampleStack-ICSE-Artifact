<p>You are reading the raw bytes from the resource (notice the method name <code>openRawResource</code>), so you aren't applying a character encoding. You need to use an <code>InputStreamReader</code> (and a <code>BufferedReader</code> is usually a good idea):</p>

<pre><code>InputStream is = this.getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.json);
Writer writer = new StringWriter();
char[] buffer = new char[1024];

try {
  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
    new InputStreamReader(is, "UTF-8")
  );
  int n;
  while ((n = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
    writer.write(buffer, 0, n);
  }
} finally {
  is.close();
}

String jsontext = writer.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to use a different character encoding (second parameter of <code>InputStreamReader</code>).</p>

<p>BTW, this has nothing to do with "HTML tags". Maybe I am missing something?</p>
