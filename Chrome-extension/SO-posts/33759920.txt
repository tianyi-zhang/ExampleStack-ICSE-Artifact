<p>As a general tip, since you didn't touch on it, I suggest doing all web requests in an IntentService so it doesn't block your UI thread. As for an answer, you can use the HttpURLConnection like this</p>

<pre><code>public String getXMLFromUrl(String url) {
    BufferedReader br = null;
    try {
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)(new URL(url)).openConnection();
        br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));

        String line;
        final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line).append("\n");
        }

        return sb.toString();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    } finally {
        try {
            if (br != null) br.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It shouldn't be too hard to understand as the code-change is minimal, but if you have any question I'd love to hear them :)</p>
