<p>You just want to copy the complete zip file? Than it is not needed to open and read the zip file... Just copy it like you would copy every other file.</p>

<pre><code>public final static int BUF_SIZE = 1024; //can be much bigger, see comment below


public static void copyFile(File in, File out) throws Exception {
  FileInputStream fis  = new FileInputStream(in);
  FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(out);
  try {
    byte[] buf = new byte[BUF_SIZE];
    int i = 0;
    while ((i = fis.read(buf)) != -1) {
        fos.write(buf, 0, i);
    }
  } 
  catch (Exception e) {
    throw e;
  }
  finally {
    if (fis != null) fis.close();
    if (fos != null) fos.close();
  }
}
</code></pre>
