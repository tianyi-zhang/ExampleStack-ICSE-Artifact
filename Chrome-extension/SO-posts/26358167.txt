<p>If you are still looking an answer you can use the below code to get the compressed byte[] using deflater and decompress it using inflater.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Some string for testing
        String sr = new String("fsdfesfsfdddddddsfdsfssdfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsdfggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghghghghggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggfsdfesfsfdddddddsfdsfssdfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsdfggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghghghghggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg");
        byte[] data = sr.getBytes();
        System.out.println("src size "+data.length);
        try {
            compress(data);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public static byte[] compress(byte[] data) throws IOException { 
        Deflater deflater = new Deflater(); 
        deflater.setInput(data); 
        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream(data.length);  

        deflater.finish(); 
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];  
        while (!deflater.finished()) { 
        int count = deflater.deflate(buffer);  
        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, count);  
        } 
        outputStream.close(); 
        byte[] output = outputStream.toByteArray(); 

        System.out.println("Original: " + data.length  ); 
        System.out.println("Compressed: " + output.length ); 
        return output; 
        }
