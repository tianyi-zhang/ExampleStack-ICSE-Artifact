<p>You can apply such effect by playing on different source code available </p>

<p>I would suggest you to go with this url and check the different effect <a href="https://xjaphx.wordpress.com/learning/tutorials/" rel="nofollow">https://xjaphx.wordpress.com/learning/tutorials/</a></p>

<p>The most relevant function i could see is mentioned below, try to modify it according to your need </p>

<pre><code>int width = mImage.getWidth();
        int height = mImage.getHeight();
        int[] pixels = new int[width * height];
        mImage.getPixels(pixels, 0, width, 0, 0, width, height);

        for(int x = 0; x &lt; pixels.length; ++x) {
            pixels[x] = (pixels[x] == fromColor) ? targetColor : pixels[x];
        }

        Bitmap newImage = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, mImage.getConfig());
        newImage.setPixels(pixels, 0, width, 0, 0, width, height);

        return newImage;
</code></pre>
