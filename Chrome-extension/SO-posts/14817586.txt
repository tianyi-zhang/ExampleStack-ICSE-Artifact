<p>I think 'Preferred' may somehow refer to the most general entry in the routing table. Who knows what those Windows crazies were thinking.</p>

<p>However, this address may also correspond to the address that is most likely to be a public IP/assigned by DHCP. If you're looking for code that gets the most likely address to be public/used to open a port on, this is what I use to get an IPv4 address:</p>

<pre><code>public static InetAddress getNetworkAddr() {
    InetAddress localAddr = null;

    // Find our public IP address
    Enumeration&lt;NetworkInterface&gt; netInterfaces;
    try {
        netInterfaces = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();
        while (netInterfaces.hasMoreElements()) {               
            NetworkInterface ni = (NetworkInterface) netInterfaces.nextElement();               
            Enumeration&lt;InetAddress&gt; addresses = ni.getInetAddresses();             
            while( addresses.hasMoreElements() ) {
                InetAddress addr = addresses.nextElement();

                // System.out.println("Checking out " + ni.getName() + " with address " + addr.toString());

                if (!addr.isSiteLocalAddress() &amp;&amp; 
                        !addr.isLoopbackAddress() &amp;&amp; 
                        !addr.isLinkLocalAddress() &amp;&amp;
                        addr.getHostAddress().indexOf(":") == -1) { // MAC/IPv6 address detection
                    System.out.println("Interface " + ni.getName()
                            + " seems to be InternetInterface. I'll take address " + addr.toString());
                    System.out.println("Associated hostname: " + addr.getHostName());
                    localAddr = addr;
                    break;
                }
            }   
            if( localAddr != null ) break;
        }
    } catch( NoSuchElementException e) {
        System.out.println("Couldn't find a public address");
        localAddr = null;
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        localAddr = null;
    }

    return localAddr;
}
