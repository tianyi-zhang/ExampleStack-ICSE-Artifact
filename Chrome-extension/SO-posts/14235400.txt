<p>As @Shay noted you can not use external SMTP provider with GAE. GAE uses it's own SMTP gateway.</p>

<p><strong>Related issue:</strong> on GAE you can only send email that originates (i.e. from field) from one of the app administrators (GAE Admin -> permissions) or currently logged-in users via Google Accounts. Note: this only works for users logged-in via Google Accounts, not for users logged in via federated login (e.g. OpenID): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10182854/sending-email-on-behalf-of-google-apps-user">Sending email on behalf of Google Apps user</a> (answer is from Google engineer)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> as noted before, the <code>username@gmail.com</code> must be the email of the user that <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/users/overview" rel="nofollow">logged into your GAE app via Google Apps login</a> or the user must be an admin of your GAE app.</p>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong> this works for me:</p>

<pre><code>Properties props = new Properties();
Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);
try {
    Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);
    msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress("admin@domain.com", "Admin", "UTF-8"));
    msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, new InternetAddress(recipientAddress));
    msg.setSubject(emailSubject);
    msg.setText(emailText);
    Transport.send(msg);

} catch (AddressException e) {
// TO address not valid
} catch (MessagingException e) {
    // other email error
} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
    // should not happen UTF-8 is always available
}
</code></pre>
