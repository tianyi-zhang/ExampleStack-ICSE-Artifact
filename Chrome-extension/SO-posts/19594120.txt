<p>Your problem is with your ImageButtons... I don't think the XML inflater is happy with you using a weight and maxHeight at the same time... But it may be passing through because one of the attributes on your ImageButtons is for a higher API. Check the developer guide for all of them or remove them one by one until the crash disappears. It seems that all your ImageButtons are mostly identical, so I'd take that down to one for testing as well...</p>

<pre><code>public int getDimensionPixelSize(int index, int defValue) {
    index *= AssetManager.STYLE_NUM_ENTRIES;
    final int[] data = mData;
    final int type = data[index+AssetManager.STYLE_TYPE];
    if (type == TypedValue.TYPE_NULL) {
        return defValue;
    } else if (type == TypedValue.TYPE_DIMENSION) {
        return TypedValue.complexToDimensionPixelSize(
            data[index+AssetManager.STYLE_DATA], mResources.mMetrics);
    }

    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Can't convert to dimension: type=0x" // Line 463 of TypedArray.java
            + Integer.toHexString(type));
}
