<p>A general purpose solution is to use what's called a 'natural order comparator'.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p><a href="http://pierre-luc.paour.9online.fr/NaturalOrderComparator.java">http://pierre-luc.paour.9online.fr/NaturalOrderComparator.java</a></p>

<p>Natural ordering is actually quite important in cases where a string might contain runs of numbers and you want things to sort alphabetically on the letters but numerically on the numbers.  Modern versions of Windows Explorer uses this for ordering file names, for example.  It's also very handy for picking out the latest version of a library based on version strings (i.e. "1.2.3" compared to to "1.20.1").</p>

<p>If your strings really just contain numbers (like you put in your description), then you are best off not using strings at all - create and work with Integer objects instead.</p>

<p>Note:  The link above seems to be broken.  The code is so useful that I'm going to post it here:</p>
