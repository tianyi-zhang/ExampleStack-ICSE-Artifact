<p>Rakesh sorry for late reply, since 10 am i was trying to resolve your issue and i have tried several times and finally below code has worked:</p>

<p>i knew you got answer, but i have given many hours for my satisfaction i am placing my answer here, and brother i don't need points for this, because @SahilMahajanMj deserve this:</p>

<pre><code>  Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL  , new String[]{"rakesh@rocketmail.com"});
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject);
        i.setType("message/rfc822");
        i.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, Html.fromHtml(body.toString()));

        try {
            startActivity(Intent.createChooser(i, "Send email via :"));
            } catch (android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex) {
            Toast.makeText(ArrowsActivity.this, "There are no email applications installed.", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
</code></pre>
