<p>Change your code block to the following</p>

<pre><code>  @RequestMapping(value = "/upload", method = RequestMethod.POST)
  public @ResponseBody String handleFileUpload(
          @RequestParam("name") String name,
          @RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {

            String yourUploadDirectory = "uploads";


      if (!file.isEmpty()) {
          try {
              byte[] bytes = file.getBytes();
              File file1 = new File("c:/" + yourUploadDirectory + "/" + name + ".uploaded");

              // You must write this line so that the designated file is first created, otherwise getParentFile() will throw error.
              file1.createNewFile();

              file1.getParentFile().mkdirs();
              BufferedOutputStream stream = new BufferedOutputStream(
                      new FileOutputStream(file1));

              stream.write(bytes);
              stream.close();
              return "You successfully uploaded " + name + " into " + name
                      + "-uploaded !";
          } catch (Exception e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
              return "You failed to upload " + name + " =&gt; " + e.getMessage();
          }
      } else {
          return "You failed to upload " + name
                  + " because the file was empty.";
      }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>It is always good to have a dedicated folder for uploads..</p>
