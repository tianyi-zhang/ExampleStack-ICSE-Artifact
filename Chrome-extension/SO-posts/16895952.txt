<p>The possible problem with your code is you are not flushing the output data. So that it might not get written to the output file. </p>

<p>Try the below code.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    String s = "Hello world!";
    int i = 143141141;
    try
    {
        //create new file with an ObjectOutputStream
        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("test.txt");
        ObjectOutputStream oout = new ObjectOutputStream(out);

        //write something in a file
        oout.writeObject(s);
        oout.flush();
        oout.writeObject(i);
        oout.flush();        
        //close the stream
        out.close();
        oout.close();

        //create an ObjectInputStream for the file we created before
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("test.txt"));
        //read and print what we wrote before
        System.out.println("" + (String) ois.readObject());
        System.out.println("" + ois.readObject());
        ois.close();
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And also if you want to read your written objects into the file then you can't because they are written as serialized objects. For textual operation with files you can consider BufferedReader or PrintWriter. see the following code.</p>

<pre><code>public class WriteToFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            String content = "This is the content to write into file";

            File file = new File("c:\\desktop\\filename.txt");

            // if file doesnt exists, then create it
            if (!file.exists()) {
                file.createNewFile();
            }

            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(file.getAbsoluteFile());
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);
            bw.write(content);
            bw.close();

            System.out.println("Done");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After this you can open your text file and can see the written content in the human readable form and it is good practice to not to give "txt" formats when you are writing objects to the file. It's misleading. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
