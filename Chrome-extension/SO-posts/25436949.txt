<p>I haven't tried exactly what is being asked here, but this will change a files permissions in any version of android:</p>

<pre><code>exec("chmod 0777 " + fileOfInterest.getAbsolutePath());  //whatever permissions you require

private void exec(String command) {
    Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
    Process process;
    try {
        process = runtime.exec(command);
        try {
            String str;
            process.waitFor();
            BufferedReader stdError = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getErrorStream()));
            while ((str = stdError.readLine()) != null) {
                Log.e("Exec",str);
                mErrOcc = true;  //I use this elsewhere to determine if an error was encountered
            }
            process.getInputStream().close();
            process.getOutputStream().close();
            process.getErrorStream().close();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            mErrOcc = true;
        }
    } catch (IOException e1) {
        mErrOcc = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is like what Shmuel was suggesting, but more complete and btw, what he suggested does work in 1.5 and higher, not 2.2 and higher.</p>
