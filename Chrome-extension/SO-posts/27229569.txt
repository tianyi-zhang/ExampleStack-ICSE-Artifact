<p>I used zxing-1.3 jar and I had to make some changes implementing code from other answers, so I will leave my solution for others. I did the following:</p>

<p>1) find zxing-1.3.jar, download it and add in properties (add external jar).</p>

<p>2) in my activity layout add ImageView and name it (in my example it was tnsd_iv_qr).</p>

<p>3) include code in my activity to create qr image (in this example I was creating QR for bitcoin payments):</p>

<pre><code>    QRCodeWriter writer = new QRCodeWriter();
    ImageView tnsd_iv_qr = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.tnsd_iv_qr);
    try {
        ByteMatrix bitMatrix = writer.encode("bitcoin:"+btc_acc_adress+"?amount="+amountBTC, BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE, 512, 512);
        int width = 512;
        int height = 512;
        Bitmap bmp = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, Bitmap.Config.RGB_565);
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {
                if (bitMatrix.get(x, y)==0)
                    bmp.setPixel(x, y, Color.BLACK);
                else
                    bmp.setPixel(x, y, Color.WHITE);
            }
        }
        tnsd_iv_qr.setImageBitmap(bmp);
    } catch (WriterException e) {
        //Log.e("QR ERROR", ""+e);

    }
</code></pre>

<p>If someone is wondering, variable "btc_acc_adress" is a String (with BTC adress), amountBTC is a double, with, of course, transaction amount.</p>
