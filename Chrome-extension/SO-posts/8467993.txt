<p>problem solved:</p>

<p>in 2.2 i wasn't having an issue</p>

<p>in 2.3, the image was saving distorted- this was fixed with a method i called "getBestPictureSize" which is basically identical to the method i used to get the best preview size for the screen aspect ratio</p>

<p>this is the method for getting best picture size for the device the app is running on...</p>

<pre><code>private Camera.Size getBestPicturSize(int width, int height)
{
        Camera.Size result=null;    
        Camera.Parameters p = camera.getParameters();
        for (Camera.Size size : p.getSupportedPictureSizes()) {
            if (size.width&lt;=width &amp;&amp; size.height&lt;=height) {
                if (result==null) {
                    result=size;
                } else {
                    int resultArea=result.width*result.height;
                    int newArea=size.width*size.height;

                    if (newArea&gt;resultArea) {
                        result=size;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    return result;

}
</code></pre>

<p>this is the surfaceChanged callback, in which the above method is utilized to properly size the picture resulting from camera.takePicture( ... );</p>

<pre><code>private Camera.Size getBestPicturSize(int width, int height)
{
        Camera.Size result=null;    
        Camera.Parameters p = camera.getParameters();
        for (Camera.Size size : p.getSupportedPictureSizes()) {
            if (size.width&lt;=width &amp;&amp; size.height&lt;=height) {
                if (result==null) {
                    result=size;
                } else {
                    int resultArea=result.width*result.height;
                    int newArea=size.width*size.height;

                    if (newArea&gt;resultArea) {
                        result=size;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    return result;

}

<p>you can also use this picture sizing method to get preview size, by switching out the line:</p>

<pre><code>for (Camera.Size size : p.getSupportedPictureSizes()) {
</code></pre>

<p>for</p>

<pre><code>for (Camera.Size size : p.getSupportedPreviewSizes()) {
</code></pre>

<p>hope this helps someone, as i spent a like 10 hours stressing over this function wouldn't work on my 2.3.4 but would on my 2.2</p>

<p>that being said- running the getBestPictureSize on 2.2 causes a force close. haven't figured out how i'm going to handle that yet</p>
