<p>It's 1 am and I finally have my app running again. Android 4.2 includes some apparently security related changes to webView.addJavascriptInterface, which stops the default bridge mode from working.</p>

<p>I expect there will be a better fix in the next version, but if you need a quick fix, try this  update to CordovaWebView.exposeJsInterface</p>

<pre><code>private void exposeJsInterface() {
    int SDK_INT = Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;
    boolean isHoneycomb = (SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB &amp;&amp; SDK_INT &lt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB_MR2);
    if (isHoneycomb || (SDK_INT &lt; Build.VERSION_CODES.GINGERBREAD)) {
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge since Android version is old.");
        // Bug being that Java Strings do not get converted to JS strings automatically.
        // This isn't hard to work-around on the JS side, but it's easier to just
        // use the prompt bridge instead.
        return;            
    } else if (SDK_INT &lt; Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB &amp;&amp; Build.MANUFACTURER.equals("unknown")) {
        // addJavascriptInterface crashes on the 2.3 emulator.
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge callback due to a bug on the 2.3 emulator");
        return;

    } else if (SDK_INT == Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1) {            
        Log.i(TAG, "Disabled addJavascriptInterface() bridge callback for 4.2");
        return;


    }
    this.addJavascriptInterface(exposedJsApi, "_cordovaNative");
}
</code></pre>
