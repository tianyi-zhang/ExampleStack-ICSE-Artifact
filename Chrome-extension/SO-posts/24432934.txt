<p>Your merge routine is wrong. The second and third while loops should <strong>not</strong> be inside the first while loop. They should be outside it.</p>

<p>The first while loop compares items of the two arrays until there are no more elements left in one of them.
Only after it is done, the second and third loops should come into play.</p>

<p>The second and third loops (only one of them actually does any work in any invocation of merge) handle the remainder of the array that contains the highest values.</p>

<p>Therefore it should look like this :</p>

<pre><code>private static void merge(int[]a,int[]b,int[]c)
{
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0; 
    while((i &lt; b.length) &amp;&amp; (j &lt; c.length))
    {
        if(b[i] &lt; c[j])
        {
            a[k++] = b[i++];   
        }
        else
        {
            a[k++] = c[j++];
        }
    }
    while( i &lt; b.length)
    {
        a[k++] = b[i++];
    }

    while( j &lt; c.length)
    {
        a[k++] = c[j++];
    }
}
</code></pre>
