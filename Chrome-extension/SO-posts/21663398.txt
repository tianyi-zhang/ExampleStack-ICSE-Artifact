<p>Over the years I had to connect to various MMSCs using MM7 protocol. SAAJ approach is a valid one, but from time to time you have to manually craft MM7 messages as MMSCs tend to be picky about exact MIME formatting, SOAP, even binary vs. base64 encoding.</p>

<p>At my company we've developed a library that manages MM7 SOAP and attachments at a low level depending only on JDOM. It works regardless of actual MM7 protocol version/schema. Recently we've decided to open source it, you can get it here <a href="https://github.com/vnesek/instantcom-mm7" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/vnesek/instantcom-mm7</a> </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>    SubmitReq sr = new SubmitReq();
    sr.setVaspId("xxx_vaspid");
    sr.setVasId("xxx_vasid");
    sr.setSubject("Nice weather");
    sr.setMessageClass(MessageClass.INFORMATIONAL);
    sr.setServiceCode("7007");
    sr.addRecipient(new Address("+385910000001", RecipientType.TO));

    // Add text content
    TextContent text = new TextContent("We got a real nice weather today.");
    text.setContentId("text");
    sr.setContent(text);

    // Initialize MM7 client to MMSC
    MMSC mmsc = new BasicMMSC(url);

    // Send a message
    SubmitRsp submitRsp = mmsc.submit(sr);
    System.out.println(submitRsp);
</code></pre>
