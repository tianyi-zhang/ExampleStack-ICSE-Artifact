<p>I dont believe this is possible (atleast not in API version 8)</p>

<p>Here is the code from CompoundButton.onDraw, which seems to indicate the CompoundButton draws buttonDrawable (which represents your checkbox image) within a bounding rect which has an offset of 0 in the parent view. </p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    super.onDraw(canvas);

    final Drawable buttonDrawable = mButtonDrawable;
    if (buttonDrawable != null) {
        final int verticalGravity = getGravity() &amp; Gravity.VERTICAL_GRAVITY_MASK;
        final int height = buttonDrawable.getIntrinsicHeight();

        int y = 0;

        switch (verticalGravity) {
            case Gravity.BOTTOM:
                y = getHeight() - height;
                break;
            case Gravity.CENTER_VERTICAL:
                y = (getHeight() - height) / 2;
                break;
        }

        buttonDrawable.setBounds(0, y, buttonDrawable.getIntrinsicWidth(), y + height);
        buttonDrawable.draw(canvas);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, try setting the width of the CheckBox to be slightly greater (in dp) than the size of the image you're using. This squeezes the button drawable and it doesn't render with all the white space on the right.</p>
