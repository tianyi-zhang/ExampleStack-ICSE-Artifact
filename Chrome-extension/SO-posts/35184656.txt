<p>You should mention the intention of your code. I think it is to print the monthly payment and total payment of a loan at different interest rates.</p>

<p>This will answer exactly that question:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Loan Amount: ");
    double loanAmount = in.nextDouble();
    System.out.print("Number of Years: ");
    int years = in.nextInt();

    double annualInterestRate = 5;

    double i = 5.0;
    int lastMonth = years * 12;
    int month = 1;

    while (i &lt;= 8.0) {
        double monthlyInterestRate = (annualInterestRate + i) / 1200;
        double monthlyPayment = loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate / (1 - 1 / Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, years * 12));
        double totalPayment = monthlyPayment * 12 * years;
        System.out.println("Interest Rate      Monthly Payment            Total Payment");
        System.out.println(i + "%                  $" + monthlyPayment + "                   $" + totalPayment);
        i += 0.125;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The answer is that you have do recalculate monthlyPayment and totalPayment at every iteration in the while loop. So I moved it into the while loop.</p>
