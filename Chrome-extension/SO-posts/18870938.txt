<pre><code> public Bitmap highlightImage(Bitmap src) {
        // create new bitmap, which will be painted and becomes result image
        Bitmap bmOut = Bitmap.createBitmap(src.getWidth() + 96, src.getHeight() + 96, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
        // setup canvas for painting
        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bmOut);
        // setup default color
        canvas.drawColor(0, PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR);
        // create a blur paint for capturing alpha
        Paint ptBlur = new Paint();
        ptBlur.setMaskFilter(new BlurMaskFilter(15, Blur.NORMAL));
        int[] offsetXY = new int[2];
        // capture alpha into a bitmap
        Bitmap bmAlpha = src.extractAlpha(ptBlur, offsetXY);
        // create a color paint
        Paint ptAlphaColor = new Paint();
        ptAlphaColor.setColor(0xFFFFFFFF);
        // paint color for captured alpha region (bitmap)
        canvas.drawBitmap(bmAlpha, offsetXY[0], offsetXY[1], ptAlphaColor);
        // free memory
        bmAlpha.recycle();

        // paint the image source
        canvas.drawBitmap(src, 0, 0, null);

        // return out final image
        return bmOut;
    }
