<p>This example changes the maximum iteration of J dynamically. We first initialize jMAX as i, and then iterates starting from 1, if it is a factor, then set jMAX as the result, for example, the factor of 10 is 2, the result is 5, we know that another factor cannot be between 5-10, since the divisor will be less than 2. After that, jMAX is reset to 100.</p>

<pre><code>int jMAX;
for(int i=2; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
            System.out.print("Factors of " + i + ": ");
            jMAX = i;
            for(int j=1; j &lt; jMAX; j++)
            {
                if((i%j) == 0) 
                    {
                        jMAX = i/j;
                        if(j!=jMAX){
                        System.out.print(j +" "+ jMAX+" ");
                        }
                        else{
                            System.out.print(j+" ");
                        }
                    }
            }
            jMAX =100;

            System.out.println();
        }

<p>number of iterations: 1950, which is 3000 iteration lesser</p>
