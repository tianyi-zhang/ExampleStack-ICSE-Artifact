<p>It's working!!</p>

<p>Thanks to you guys saying it was supposed to work I kept searching for the problem comparing with the examples in which I have TabHost working by itself.</p>

<p>The issue was with my onCreate() method. I needed to get the tab host and add the tabs there, I (for some reason) thought it was enough just in the xml. </p>

<p>My onCreate ended up looking something like this: (for someone making the same dumb mistake as me)</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    TabHost mTabHost = getTabHost();
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test1").setIndicator("Tab 1").setContent(R.id.textview1));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test2").setIndicator("Tab 2").setContent(R.id.textview2));
    mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test3").setIndicator("Tab 3").setContent(R.id.textview3));

    mTabHost.setCurrentTab(0);        

}
</code></pre>
