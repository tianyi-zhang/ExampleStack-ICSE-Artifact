<p>This question is a bit old, but I figured I should post my answer now that <code>DefaultHttpClient</code>, <code>HttpGet</code>, etc. are deprecated. This function should get and return HTML, given a URL.</p>

<pre><code>public static String getHtml(String url) throws IOException {
    // Build and set timeout values for the request.
    URLConnection connection = (new URL(url)).openConnection();
    connection.setConnectTimeout(5000);
    connection.setReadTimeout(5000);
    connection.connect();

    // Read and store the result line by line then return the entire string.
    InputStream in = connection.getInputStream();
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
    StringBuilder html = new StringBuilder();
    for (String line; (line = reader.readLine()) != null; ) {
        html.append(line);
    }
    in.close();

    return html.toString();
}
</code></pre>
