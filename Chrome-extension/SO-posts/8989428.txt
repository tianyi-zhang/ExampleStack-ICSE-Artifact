<p>I can't find any existing Collator for danish; the built-in one for the Danish locale is  supposed to be correct. I am not sure that your assumption that <code>ae</code> should be sorted with <code>æ</code> holds, specifically due to certain foreign words (for example <a href="http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Fremmedord/a-ak/aerofobi" rel="nofollow">"aerofobi"</a>) in danish (I am not a danish speaker, though I do speak swedish).</p>

<p>But, if you want to sort them together, it seems like you have two ways to do this, depending upon which context you're in. In certain contexts, just replacing the characters might be approprite:</p>

<pre><code>String str = "USA lover graekenland støtte";
String sortStr = str.replace("ae", "æ");
</code></pre>

<p>The other, perhaps better, option is the one you specified; using  <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>. Using the example from the javadocs, this is pretty trivial:</p>

<pre><code>String danish = "&lt; a, A &lt; b, B &lt; c, C &lt; d, D &lt; e, E &lt; f, F &lt; g, G &lt; h, H &lt; i, I" +
                "&lt; j, J &lt; k, K &lt; l, L &lt; m, M &lt; n, N &lt; o, O &lt; p, P &lt; q, Q &lt; r, R" +
                "&lt; s, S &lt; t, T &lt; u, U &lt; v, V &lt; w, W &lt; x, X &lt; y, Y &lt; z, Z" +
                "&lt; \u00E6 = ae," +       // Latin letter ae
                "  \u00C6 = AE " +       // Latin letter AE
                "&lt; \u00F8, \u00D8" +     // Latin letter o &amp; O with stroke
                "&lt; \u00E5 = a\u030A," +  // Latin letter a with ring above
                "  \u00C5 = A\u030A;" +  // Latin letter A with ring above
                "  aa, AA";
RuleBasedCollator danishCollator = new RuleBasedCollator(danish);
</code></pre>

<p>Which you can then use:</p>

<pre><code>String test1 = "USA lover Grækenland støtte";
String test2 = "USA lover Graekenland støtte";         // note capital 'G'
boolean result = danishCollator.equals(test1, test2);  // true
</code></pre>

<p>If you believe that the default collator is incorrect, you may wish to <a href="http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/" rel="nofollow">report a bug</a>. (There have previously been <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4804273" rel="nofollow">similar bugs</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I checked this with a printed danish-language encyclopedia. There are indeed word which begin with 'ae' (primarily words from foreign languages; "aerobics", for example) which are <strong>not</strong> sorted with (and therefore not equal to) word beginning with 'æ'. So although I see why you would want to treat them as equal in many circumstances, they are not strictly so.</p>
