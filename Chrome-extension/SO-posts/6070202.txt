<p>If colors are in RGB space, it is pretty simple (but the result is sometimes not that satisfying):</p>

<pre><code>public int mixColors(int col1, int col2) {
    int r1, g1, b1, r2, g2, b2;

    r1 = Color.red(col1);
    g1 = Color.green(col1);
    b1 = Color.blue(col1);

    r2 = Color.red(col2);
    g2 = Color.green(col2);
    b2 = Color.blue(col2);

    int r3 = (r1 + r2)/2;
    int g3 = (g1 + g2)/2;
    int b3 = (b1 + b2)/2;

    return Color.rgb(r3, g3, b3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use other color spaces, search Wikipedia and find HSL color space. You also have some libraries to do that for you. </p>
