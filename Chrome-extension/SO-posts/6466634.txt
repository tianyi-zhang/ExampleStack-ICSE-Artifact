<p>I believe you want to implement a Screen with few seconds delay and then start your main Application. Just like a Splash Screen Before the Main Application Starts Right?  </p>

<p>Then this will help you!</p>

<pre><code> /** Called when the activity is first created. */
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
    /** set time to splash out */
    final int welcomeScreenDisplay = 4000;
    /** create a thread to show splash up to splash time */
    Thread welcomeThread = new Thread() {

    int wait = 0;

    @Override
    public void run() {
    try {
    super.run();
    /**
    * use while to get the splash time. Use sleep() to increase
    * the wait variable for every 100L.
    */
    while (wait &lt; welcomeScreenDisplay) {
    sleep(100);
    wait += 100;
    }
    } catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("EXc=" + e);
    } finally {
    /**
    * Called after splash times up. Do some action after splash
    * times up. Here we moved to another main activity class
    */
    startActivity(new Intent(CurrentActivity.this, NextActivity.class));
    finish();
    }
    }
    };
    welcomeThread.start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a Screen for 4 seconds of Delay.</p>
