<p>This is from a project I was working on sometime back. You can load the image as a Bitmap, resize it and then set it to the ImageView</p>

<pre><code>public static Bitmap resizeBitmap(Bitmap bm, int newWidth, int newHeight) {
    int width = bm.getWidth();
    int height = bm.getHeight();
    float scaleWidth = ((float) newWidth) / width;
    float scaleHeight = ((float) newHeight) / height;
    // CREATE A MATRIX FOR THE MANIPULATION
    Matrix matrix = new Matrix();
    // RESIZE THE BIT MAP
    matrix.postScale(scaleWidth, scaleHeight);

    // "RECREATE" THE NEW BITMAP
    Bitmap resizedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(
                bm, 0, 0, width, height, matrix, false);
    bm.recycle();
    return resizedBitmap;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But before you do this, I would strongly recommend you scale down the sampling of the input images (as you probably can do with a lower image resolution) or you may be dealing with images using a lot of memory and quickly run into the OutOfMemoryError.  The code for this is provided by Google.</p>
