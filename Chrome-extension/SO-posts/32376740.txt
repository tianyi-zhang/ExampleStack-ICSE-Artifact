<p>Nobody's gonna run and debug your code. Here are a few points to help:</p>

<p>1/ Assuming your app uploaded your DB file (GooDrive does not care if it is DB or anything else - just a byte stream). Record/save it's DriveId - it should look like "<em>DriveId:CAES........</em>"</p>

<p>2/ check if the file in GooDrive (drive.google.com) has the size you expect. You can also use third party SQLite web app to check the state of your DB file in the Drive (make sure you created/uploaded it with correct MIME type).</p>

<p>3/ In you Android app, pass your saved DriveId to this method:</p>

<pre><code>  private static GoogleApiClient mGAC;
  ...
  /*******************************************************************
   * get file contents
   * @param dId  file driveId
   */
  static void read(DriveId dId) {
    byte[] buf = null;
    if (mGAC != null &amp;&amp; mGAC.isConnected() &amp;&amp; dId != null) {
      DriveFile df = Drive.DriveApi.getFile(mGAC, dId);
      df.open(mGAC, DriveFile.MODE_READ_ONLY, null)
                               .setResultCallback(new ResultCallback&lt;DriveContentsResult&gt;() {
        @Override
        public void onResult(DriveContentsResult rslt) {
          if ((rslt != null) &amp;&amp; rslt.getStatus().isSuccess()) {
            DriveContents cont = rslt.getDriveContents();
            byte[] buf = UT.is2Bytes(cont.getInputStream());
            int size = buf.length;
            cont.discard(mGAC);    // or cont.commit();  they are equiv if READONLY
          }
        }
      });
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>4/ check the size/state/content of the byte buffer you downloaded. You can write it back to the DB file as well. </p>

<p>These steps should get you closer to resolving your error.</p>

<p>Good Luck</p>
