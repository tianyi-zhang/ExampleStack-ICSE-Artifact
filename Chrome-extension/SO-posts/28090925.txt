<p><strong>Many answers here suggest to use</strong> <code>Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + appPackageName))</code> <strong>to open Google Play, but I think it is insufficient</strong> in fact: </p>

<p><strong>Some third-party applications can use its own intent-filters with <code>"market://"</code> scheme defined</strong>, thus they can process supplied Uri instead of Google Play (I experienced this situation with e.g.SnapPea application). The question is "How to open the Google Play Store?", so I assume, that you do not want to open any other application. Please also note, that e.g. app rating is only relevant in GP Store app etc...</p>

<p><strong>To open Google Play AND ONLY Google Play I use this method:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static void openAppRating(Context context) {
    Intent rateIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + context.getPackageName()));
    boolean marketFound = false;

    // find all applications able to handle our rateIntent
    final List&lt;ResolveInfo&gt; otherApps = context.getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(rateIntent, 0);
    for (ResolveInfo otherApp: otherApps) {
        // look for Google Play application
        if (otherApp.activityInfo.applicationInfo.packageName.equals("com.android.vending")) {

            ActivityInfo otherAppActivity = otherApp.activityInfo;
            ComponentName componentName = new ComponentName(
                    otherAppActivity.applicationInfo.packageName,
                    otherAppActivity.name
                    );
            rateIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED);
            rateIntent.setComponent(componentName);
            context.startActivity(rateIntent);
            marketFound = true;
            break;

        }
    }

    // if GP not present on device, open web browser
    if (!marketFound) {
        Intent webIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id="+context.getPackageName()));
        context.startActivity(webIntent);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The point is that when more applications beside Google Play can open our intent, app-chooser dialog is skipped and GP app is started directly.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 
Sometimes it seems that it opens GP app only, without opening the app's profile. As TrevorWiley suggested in his comment, <code>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</code> could fix the problem. (I didn't test it myself yet...)</p>
