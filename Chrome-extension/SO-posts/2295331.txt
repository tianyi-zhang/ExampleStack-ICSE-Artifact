<p>There's no guarantee that the content length you're provided is actually correct.  Try something akin to the following:</p>

<pre><code>ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
InputStream is = null;
try {
  is = url.openStream ();
  byte[] byteChunk = new byte[4096]; // Or whatever size you want to read in at a time.
  int n;

  while ( (n = is.read(byteChunk)) &gt; 0 ) {
    baos.write(byteChunk, 0, n);
  }
}
catch (IOException e) {
  System.err.printf ("Failed while reading bytes from %s: %s", url.toExternalForm(), e.getMessage());
  e.printStackTrace ();
  // Perform any other exception handling that's appropriate.
}
finally {
  if (is != null) { is.close(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll then have the image data in <code>baos</code>, from which you can get a byte array by calling <code>baos.toByteArray()</code>.</p>

<p>This code is untested (I just wrote it in the answer box), but it's a reasonably close approximation to what I think you're after.</p>
