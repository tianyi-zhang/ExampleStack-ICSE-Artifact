<p>I think there is some confusion in your program - when you do :</p>

<pre><code>AWSCredentials credentials=null;
credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("****","****");
credentials = new ProfileCredentialsProvider().getCredentials();
</code></pre>

<p>the line <code>credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("****","****");</code> is finally not necessary, as credentials will be set and after replaced with the one from the ProfileCredentialsProvider.</p>

<p>You cannot use at the same time the <code>BasicAWSCredentials</code> and the <code>ProfileCredentialsProvider</code></p>

<p>When you use <code>ProfileCredentialsProvider</code> you need to have a valid credential file under <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> the file should be in the form</p>

<pre><code>[default]
aws_access_key_id=XXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=XXXX
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you'll do</p>

<pre><code>    AWSCredentials credentials = null;
    try {
        credentials = new ProfileCredentialsProvider().getCredentials();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new AmazonClientException(
                "Cannot load the credentials from the credential profiles file. " +
                "Please make sure that your credentials file is at the correct " +
                "location (~/.aws/credentials), and is in valid format.",
                e);
    }
    AmazonEC2 ec2 = new AmazonEC2Client(credentials);
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not use the credential file, you can create the credentials from API from the <code>BasicAWSCredentials</code> as you did:</p>

<pre><code>AWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("XXXXX", "XXXXX");
// no need to call the ProfileCredentialsProvider in this case
ec2 = new AmazonEC2Client(credentials);
</code></pre>

<p><p></p>

<p><em>Just a simple note</em>, I understand you might run a quick test and you make it work from a main method, but really declaring <code>static AmazonEC2 ec2;</code> is a bad practice, the EC2Client should not be static. (in simple program it can be alright but as your infrastructure is growing (multiple region, instances ...) , it is just not possible)</p>
