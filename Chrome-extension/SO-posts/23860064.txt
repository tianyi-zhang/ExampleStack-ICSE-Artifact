<p>I would suggest to go on different kind of method which is more correct to do..</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    BufferedReader br = null;
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

    try {

        String sCurrentLine;

        br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("C:\\testing.txt"));

        while ((sCurrentLine = br.readLine()) != null) {
            lines.add(sCurrentLine);
        }

    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        try {
            if (br != null)br.close();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This will do the trick perfectly.. hope that helps</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you would like to read file from classpath of the project you can use the following:</p>

<pre><code> InputStream in = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("SomeTextFile.txt"); 
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in, "UTF-8")); 
</code></pre>

<p>Somethink like that will be fine.. I am not saying you cannot do it with scanner.. IMHO I think this is better.. But it is a matter of choice and not big architecture problem.. Consideration is yours :)</p>
