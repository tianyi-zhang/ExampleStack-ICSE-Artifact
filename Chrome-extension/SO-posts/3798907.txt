<p>Your question is not very clear, But I assume you are asking why there is a difference in the output.There are two matches found for the regex pattern you passed in the string. So when you said replaceAll both the matches were replaced and when replaceFirst is used only the first one is replaced. Hence the difference in the output. To find the matches -</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Regex {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String string1 = new String("TEST|X||Y|Z||");           

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(TEST\\|[\\|\\|]*\\\\|)\\|\\|");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(string1);

        boolean found = false;
        while (matcher.find()) {
            System.out.printf("I found the text \"%s\" starting at "
                    + "index %d and ending at index %d.%n", matcher.group(),
                    matcher.start(), matcher.end());
            found = true;
        }
        if (!found) {
            System.out.printf("No match found.%n");
        }
    }
}
