<p>If you are using Emulator then you can access your database, just by pulling it out from <strong>File Manager</strong> from following path: <code>data/data/com.my.package/databases/mydb.sqlite</code></p>

<p>If you are running your application on your device then use following code to get database from your above filePath (since you cannot access internal file system of android device)</p>

<pre><code>try {
            File sd = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
            File data = Environment.getDataDirectory();

            if (sd.canWrite()) {
                String currentDBPath = "/data/com.yourApp.common/databases/yourApp.db";
                String backupDBPath = "/yourApp.db";
                File currentDB = new File(data, currentDBPath);
                File backupDB = new File(sd, backupDBPath);

                if (currentDB.exists()) {
                    FileChannel src = new FileInputStream(currentDB)
                            .getChannel();
                    FileChannel dst = new FileOutputStream(backupDB)
                            .getChannel();
                    dst.transferFrom(src, 0, src.size());
                    src.close();
                    dst.close();
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
</code></pre>

<p>After that, once you have your db file, you can view it from Mozilla add On (Plugin) called SQLte Manager. Use this: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/</a> to download it.</p>
