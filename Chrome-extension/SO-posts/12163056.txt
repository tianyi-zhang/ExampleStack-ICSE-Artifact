<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>private class MyService extends Service implements AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener {
    public void onAudioFocusChange(int focusChange) {
        switch (focusChange) {
            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS:
                Log.e(TAG, "AudioFocus: received AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS, turning FM off");
                break;
            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK:
                Log.e(TAG, "AudioFocus: received AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK");
                break;
            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT:
                Log.e(TAG, "AudioFocus: received AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT");
                break;
            case AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN:
                Log.v(TAG, "AudioFocus: received AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN");
                break;
            default:
                Log.e(TAG, "Unknown audio focus change code " + focusChange);
        }
    }

    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>mAudioManager.requestAudioFocus(new MyService(), AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN);
</code></pre>

<p>Its works for me.</p>
