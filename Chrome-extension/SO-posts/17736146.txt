<p>I figured this out.  Somehow, the Hash Key just stopped matching what I had inserted on the Facebook side.  Using the facebook documentation, I added in code in my onCreate method that told me what the hash key was in my LogCat.  I also added in some logging code for my catch exceptions in the event that I was screwing up my package name.  This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>try {
            PackageInfo info = getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(
                    "com.your.package", 
                    PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
            for (Signature signature : info.signatures) {
                MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
                md.update(signature.toByteArray());
                Log.d("KeyHash:", Base64.encodeToString(md.digest(), Base64.DEFAULT));
                }
        } catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
            Log.d("Error1", "NameNotFoundException");

        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            Log.d("Error2", "Algorthim");

        }
</code></pre>

<p>After I added that and ran it, I found the hash key in my log cat, and then just copied that to my Facebook App.  Saved it, ran the app again and it worked!</p>
