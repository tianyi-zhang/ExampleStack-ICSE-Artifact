<p>Its actually not an error, you have by mistake created a class name with AlertDialog which is actually already resides in the android Package. Now when you have created the class with AlertDialog  and you are trying to access its Builder method it gives you an error, because your custom class doesnt have that method. </p>

<p>Simple solution for your question is just rename your AlertDialog class to some other class name and your problem will get solve. </p>

<p>Note : there is no other error in your code.</p>

<p>I suggest you to change your class name to any other name for example say MyAlertDialog, then your class code will be like below, ( also you need to change your file name according your public class as rule of Java File naming convention,</p>

<pre><code>public class MyAlertDialog // See change is here
{
    public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) 
    {
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
        builder.setMessage("Time: " + SMSReceiver.getTime() + "\nIncident: " + 
                SMSReceiver.getCallType() + "\nLocation: " + SMSReceiver.getAddress())
                .setPositiveButton(R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {


                    }
                })
                .setNegativeButton(R.string.cancel, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {


                    }
                });

        return builder.create();

    }
}
</code></pre>
