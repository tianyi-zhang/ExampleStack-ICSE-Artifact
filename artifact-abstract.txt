This is an artifact submission for Paper 401. 

This artifact aims to reproduce the major findings in our empirical study of common adaptation types when reusing code snippets from Stack Overflow (SO) to GitHub, as well as sharing research prototypes developed based on these findings. First, we provide a comprehensive dataset that includes 14,124 SO code snippets and their GitHub counterparts, among which 629 are explicitly attributed by GitHub developers via SO URLs. Second, we provide the manual inspection spreadsheet used to develop 24 common adaptation types and also an automated adaptation analysis tool that classifies program changes between a SO code snippet and its GitHub counterpart to these 24 categories. Third, we provide a Chrome extension called ExampleStack that visualizes similar GitHub code fragments alongside a SO code example and allows a user to explore variations of a given SO example in an adaptation-type aware code template. 

We want to claim the "reusable" and "available" badges. Reviewers should be familar with Java, since our study focuses on online code examples written in Java and reviewers need to run our tools in Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We have tested our tools on Mac OS Mojave with Java 8 and Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (64 bit), as well as Ubuntu 14.04 with Java 8 and Chrome 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit). But presumably, our tools are not restricted to specific versions of JVM or Chrome Web Browser.
